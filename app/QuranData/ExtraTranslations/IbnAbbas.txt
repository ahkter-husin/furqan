1|1|In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
1|2|And on his authority it is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, regarding the saying of Allah, Exalted is He, (Praise beto Allah): 'He says: laudation is Allah's in that He is kind towards His created beings and, hence, they praiseHim. It is also said that laudation is Allah's because of His excessive blessings upon His servants whom Hehas guided to believe in Him. It is also said: laudation, absolute unity and godhood all belong to Allah Whohas neither progeny, partner, helper nor an assistant. (Lord of the worlds): Lord of any that has a spirit andwalks about on the face of the earth and also of the dwellers of heaven. It is also said that this means: theMaster of the jinn and human beings. It is also said that (Lord of the worlds) means the Creator of allcreated beings, their Provider and the One Who changes them from one state into another.
1|3|(The Beneficent) the Gentle. (The Merciful) the Gentle.
1|4|(Owner of the Day of Judgement) the Arbitrator on the Day of Judgement which is the Day of Reckoningand settlement of disputes between created beings, i.e. the Day when people are judged according to theirdeeds; there is no judge save Him.
1|5|(Thee (alone) we worship), we turn to you as the only One God and we obey you; ((Thee alone) we ask forhelp), we ask for your help in worshipping You and from You we obtain confidence in obeying You.
1|6|(Guide us to the straight path) guide us to the established Religion that You are pleased with, i.e. Islam. It isalso said that this means: make us firm in holding fast to it. It is also said that the straight path refers toAllah's Book, and guidance to this means guidance to that which it prescribes as lawful or unlawful and tothe exposition of its content.
1|7|(The path of those whom Thou hast favoured), the Religion of those whom You have blessed with theReligion and who are the followers of Moses, before the blessings of Allah deserted them, in that He shadedthem with a white cloud and sent down on them honey and quails when they were in the wilderness. It isalso said that (the path of those whom Thou hast favoured) refers to the prophets. (Not of those who earnThine anger), not the religion of the Jews who earned Your anger, whom You forsook and whose hearts Youdid not protect until they became complaisant. (Nor of those who go astray), nor the religion of theChristians who erred from Islam. Amen: thus shall be its custodians; it is also said that Amen means let it beso. It is also said that it means: O our Lord! Do with us as we have requested You. And Allah knows best'.
2|1|And on his authority>'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak>'Ali Ibn Ishaq al-Samarqandi>Muhammad Ibn Marwan>al-Kalbi>Abu Salih that Ibn 'Abbas said, concerning Allah's saying, Exalted is He, (Alif. Lam. Mim): 'Alif standsfor Allah, Lam for the Archangel Gabriel (Jibril) and Mim for Muhammad. It is also said Alif stands for Allah'sblessings (ala'uh), Lam for His kindness (lutfuh) and Mim for His dominion (mulkuh). It is also said that Alifstands for the beginning of the Name Allah, Lam for the beginning of His Name the Kind (al-Latif) and Mimfor the beginning of His Name the Glorious (al-Majid). It is also said that only Allah knows the meaning ofthese disjointed letters; while some maintain that it is an oath that He made.
2|2|(This is the Scripture), i.e. this is the Book that Muhammad (pbuh) is reciting to you; (whereof there is nodoubt). There is no doubt that it has come from Me; if you believe in it, I shall guide you, but if you do notbelieve in it, I will torment you. It is also said that (This is the Scripture) refers to the Guarded Tablet. It isalso said that this means: This is the Book that I promised to reveal to you on the Day of the Covenant(yawm al-mithaq). It is also said (this is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt) means there is no doubtthat the description and traits of Muhammad are found in the Torah and Gospel. (A guidance unto thosewho ward off (evil)), means that the Qur'an is an exposition for those who ward off disbelief, associatingpartners with Allah and indecencies. It is also said that it means: it is a favour to the believers; or that itmeans it is a mercy unto those who ward off evil from among the community of Muhammad (pbuh).
2|3|(Who believe in the unseen), that which is hidden from them such as Paradise, hell, the Bridge over hell, theScale, the Resurrection, the Reckoning, etc. It is also said that this means: that they believe in the unseenwhich is revealed in the Qur'an and also in that which is not revealed therein. It is also said that the unseenis Allah Himself. (And establish worship), they perform to completion the five prescribed prayers, includingthe ablution that precedes them, the bowing and prostrations which are parts of them and also what isobligated in these prayers in terms of appointed timing. (And spend of that We have bestowed upon them),and of that which We have given them of wealth they give to charity. It is also said that this means: theygive the poor-due (Zakat) from their wealth. The reference here is to Abu Bakr and his companions.
2|4|(And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad)) of the Qur'an (and that which wasrevealed before you) of scriptures given to all the prophets, (and are certain of the Hereafter), they believein resurrection after death and in the bliss of Paradise, referring here specifically to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam andhis followers.
2|5|(These) who have these traits, (are on guidance from their Lord), they enjoy favour, mercy and clearexposition that has come down from their Lord, (and these are the successful ones), the ones who shallescape Allah's wrath and torment. It is also said that this refers to those who have apprehended and foundwhat they were seeking and have escaped the evil of that from which they were fleeing, and these are theCompanions of Muhammad (pbuh).
2|6|(As for the disbelievers) who remain firm in their disbelief, (whether thou warn them), instil fear into themby means of the Qur'an, (or thou warm them not) or you do not instil fear into them, (it is all one for them;they believe not), they do not want to believe. It is also said that they will not believe as it is in Allah'sknowledge.
2|7|(Allah hath sealed their hearts), stamped their hearts, (and their hearing, and on their eyes there is acovering), on their eyes there is a shield (and theirs will be an awful doom) an awful torment in theHereafter. This refers in particular to the Jews Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy IbnAkhtab. It is also said that it refers to the idolaters of Mecca 'Utbah [Ibn Rabi'ah], Shaybah [Ibn Rabi'ah] andal-Walid [Ibn al-Mughirah].
2|8|(And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah), i.e. in the open and we are genuine in our belief,(and the last Day) and we believe in resurrection after death whereupon our deeds shall be requited, (whenthey believe not) i.e. secretly nor are they genuine in their belief.
2|9|(They try to deceive Allah) contravene against Him and denying Him in secret. It is also said that this meansthat they were so daring with Allah to the extent that they thought they had deceived Him; (and those whobelieve), Abu Bakr and all the Companions of Muhammad Allah bless him and give him peace; (and theydeceive) lie to (none save themselves; but they perceive not), they do not know that Allah informs HisProphet about that which lies secret in their hearts.
2|10|(In their hearts is a disease), doubt, hypocrisy, conflict and darkness (so Allah increaseth their disease),increased their doubt, hypocrisy, conflict and darkness. (And a painful doom is theirs), they will have apainful torment in the Hereafter which shall extend to their hearts, (because they lie) in secret, the referencehere being to the hypocrites: 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy, Jadd Ibn Qays and Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr.
2|11|(And when it is said unto them), i.e. the Jews (Make not mischief in the land) by preventing people from theReligion of Muhammad (pbuh) (they say: we are reformers only), we are reforming it through obedience.
2|12|(They are indeed the mischief mongers) by being a hindrance. (But they perceive not): the followers do notknow that their leaders mislead them.
2|13|(And when it is said unto them) i.e. to Jews, (believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) (as the people believe), i.e.'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (they say: Shall we believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an,(as the foolish believe?), i.e. as the stupid and ignorant do, (Surely they are the fools) the stupid andignorant. (But they know not) that they are so.
2|14|(And when they), i.e. the hypocrites, (fall in with those who believe), i.e. Abu Bakr and his companions,(they say: We believe) deep in our hearts and are genuine in our faith just as you believe deep in yourhearts and are genuine in your faith; (but when they go apart to their devils), to their soothsayers andleaders who were five in number, namely, Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf in Medina, Abu Burdah al-Aslami in BanuAslam, Ibn al-Sawda' in Historic Syria (al-Sham), 'Abd al-Dar in Juhaynah and 'Awf Ibn 'Amir in Banu 'Amir,(they declare) to their leaders: (Lo! We are with you) we follow your religion in secret; (surely we did butmock) Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions.
2|15|(Allah (Himself) doth mock them), in the Hereafter, i.e. He will open a gate of Paradise for them and thenshut it before their eyes and so the believers will mock them. (Leaving them to wander blindly on in theircontumacy) He will leave them in this world blind in their disbelief and error, unable to see either faith orguidance.
2|16|(These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance), they chose disbelief instead of faith andexchanged guidance with error, (so their commerce did not prosper), they did not prosper in their bargainbut on the contrary (neither were they guided) to overcome their error.
2|17|(Their likeness), the likeness of the hypocrites vis-�-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one whokindleth fire), lights a fire in the darkness in order to provide safety for his family, property and person, (andwhen it sheddeth its light around him), when it sheds its light and he sees what is around him and feelssecure, at that very moment the Fire is put out. Likewise, the hypocrites believed openly in Muhammad(pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an and by doing so they felt their persons, families and properties were safe,avoiding in the process imprisonment or death. But when they die (Allah taketh away their light), the benefitof their [outward] faith, (and leaveth them in darkness) facing the hardships of the grave, (where theycannot see) any comfort. It is also said this simile refers to the Jews. In this respect, the likeness of theJews vis-�-vis Muhammad (pbuh) is like a man who raises a flag in a lost battle and by doing so attractsother defeated fighters. But when they gather they put their flag down and, consequently, their benefit andsafety immediately vanish. Similarly, the Jews used to say that Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, prior toits revelation, would support them. When it was revealed however they denied it and Allah took away theirlight, i.e. their desire to believe and the benefit of such belief. This is because although they wanted tobelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) they did not do so, and consequently they were left them in the error ofJudaism, unable to see guidance.
2|18|(Deaf) pretending to be deaf, (dumb) pretending to be dumb, (and blind) pretending to be blind; (so theyreturn not) from their disbelief and error.
2|19|(Or like a rainstorm from the sky). This is another simile, whereby the likeness of the hypocrites and Jewsvis-�-vis the Qur'an is like rain that has poured down from heaven at night onto the wilderness, (wherein isdarkness, thunder and the flash of lightening). Such is the Qur'an. For it has come down from Allah; itcontains darkness as embodied in the exposition of seditions, thunderings of rebuke whereby fear is instilled,lightening of exposition, instruction and promise. (They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of thethunder-claps) due to the sound of the thunder (for fear of death), for fear of misfortune and death.Similarly, the Jews and hypocrites used to put their fingers in their ears when they heard the Qur'an recited,delivering promises and threats like thunder-claps, and this they did for fear of death, i.e. for fear of beingdrawn to it. (And Allah encompasseth the disbelievers) and hypocrites, i.e. He knows them and will gatherthem in hell.
2|20|(The lightning), i.e. fire, (almost snatcheth away their sight from them), i.e. from the unbelievers. Similarly,the exposition of the Qur'an almost snatched away their error. (As often as it flasheth forth), the lightening,(for them they walk therein) in the brightness of lightening, (and when it darkeneth against them they standstill) they remain in darkness. Likewise, when the hypocrites declared themselves to be believers, they wentalong with that which the believers went along with because their outward faith was accepted. But whenthey died, they remained in the darkness of the grave. (And if Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing),take away the thunder, (and their sight) the lightening. Likewise, if Allah willed, He could take away thehearing of the hypocrites and Jews through the rebukes and threats contained in the Qur'an, and He couldalso take away their sight through the exposition contained therein. (Indeed Allah is able to do all things) interms of destroying their hearing and sight.
2|21|(O mankind!) O people of Mecca; and it is also said that this refers to the Jews, (Worship your Lord), declareHim as the only One God, (Who hath created you) as different lineages beginning from a drop of sperm,(and those before you) just as He created those who came before you, (so that ye may ward off) so thatyou may ward off His wrath and torment and obey Him.
2|22|(Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you), a place for dwelling and sleeping, (and the sky acanopy), raised high above; (and causeth water to pour down from the sky), i.e. rain, (thereby producing)through this rain (fruits) different kinds of fruit (as food for you) as sustenance for you and all createdbeings. (So do not set up rivals to Allah) do not say that Allah has peers, different forms or coequals (whenyou know) that He is the fashioner of all these things. It is also said that (when you know) means: when youknow from your own scripture that Allah does not have a son, coequal or peer.
2|23|(And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We revealed) through the Archangel Gabriel (unto Our slave)Muhammad whom you accuse of fabrication, (then produce a surah like it) produce a surah like the surah ofthe Cow (al-Baqarah), (and call your witnesses), seek help from the gods that you worship, (apart fromAllah), it is said that this refers to their leaders, (if ye are truthful) in your claim.
2|24|(And if ye do it not-and you can never do it-) this you can never do and if you try you will never succeed(then guard yourselves against the Fire) if you are bent on not believing, for you should fear hell (whose fuelis men) the unbelievers, (and stones) of sulphur, (prepared) created, prepared and preordained (fordisbelievers).
2|25|Then He mentioned the favours enjoyed by the believers in Paradise, saying: (And give glad tidings untothose who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) of obedience that bind totheir Lord; and it is also that this refers to doing any righteous deeds; (that theirs are Gardens beneathwhich), trees and habitations, (rivers flow) rivers of wine, milk, honey and water; (as often as they areprovided with food), whenever they are fed in Paradise (of the fruit thereof) with different kinds of fruit,(they say: This is what was given us before), this is what we ate before, (and it is given to them) i.e. thefood (in resemblance) as far as the colour is concerned but not the taste which is different. (There for them)in Paradise (are pure spouses), pure from menses or any kind of filth, (therein), in Paradise, (forever theyabide) dwelling forever: never to die or be banished from it.
2|26|Then Allah mentioned the Jews' objection to the Qur'an's similes, saying: (Lo! Allah disdaineth not), Hecannot abstain from coining similes, and how can He disdain mentioning something that if all created beingwere to join forces to create, they would not be able to do so. Allah does not disdain (to coin the similitude)Allah does not disdain explaining to people a similitude (even of a gnat), even regarding a gnat, (or what isabove it) let alone a simile of something greater than a gnat such as a fly, or a spider. (Those who believe)in Muhammad and the Qur'an (know that it), the simile, (is the Truth from their Lord; but those whodisbelieve), in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such similitude?) say: OMuhammad! What Allah wishes by such simile is that (He misleadeth many thereby) of the Jews from thetrue Religion, (and He guideth many thereby) of the believers, (and He misleadeth thereby), by such similes,(only miscreants), the Jews.
2|27|(Those who break the covenant of Allah) regarding this Prophet (pbuh) (after ratifying it), after sanctioning,confirming and vouchsafing it (and sever that which Allah hath ordered) of oaths and kinsfolk relations (tobe joined) to Muhammad, (and (who) make mischief in the earth) by preventing people from the Religion ofMuhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an: (Those are they who are the losers), the duped in that they lose boththis world and the Hereafter.
2|28|(How disbelieve you in Allah) how astonishing that you disbelieve in Allah (when you were dead) spermdrops in the loins of your fathers (and He gave life to you!) in the wombs of your mothers. (Then He willgive you death) when your lifespan ends, (then life again) for the Resurrection, (and then unto Him ye willbe returned) in the Hereafter whereupon He shall requite you for your works.
2|29|Allah then proceeded to mention His blessings on them, saying (He it is Who created for you), madesubservient for you (all that is in the earth) of beasts, plants and other things, as a blessing from Him. (Thenturned He to the heaven) i.e. He turned to the creation of the heaven, (and fashioned it as seven heavens)positioning them vertically above the earth. (And He is Knower of all things) regarding the creation of theheavens and earth.
2|30|Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned the story of the angels who were commanded to prostrate to Adam,saying: (And when your Lord said unto the angels) who were already on the earth: (Lo! I am about to placea vicegerent in the earth), I am creating a vicegerent from the earth, (they said: Wilt Thou place therein),will you create therein (one who will do harm therein) by committing sin (and will shed blood) throughtransgression, (while we, we hymn Thy praise), pray following Your command (and sanctify Thee) andmention you in a state of purity? (He said: Surely I know that) which shall ensue from this vicegerent (whichyou know not).
2|31|(And He taught Adam all the names), the names of all his progeny, or the names of all the beasts and otherthings, including: a cooking pot, a plate and saucer, (then showed them) to prove that they were wrong (tothe angels) who were commanded to prostrate, (saying: Inform Me of the names of these) created beingsand descendents, (if ye are truthful) in your first claim.
2|32|(They said: Be glorified!), we repent to you of what we said (We have no knowledge saving that which Thouhast taught us), inspired us with. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower) of us and of them (the Wise)regarding our matters and theirs.
2|33|(He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said:Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth?) the unseen that will take place inthe heavens and on the earth. (And I know that which ye disclose), what you show to your Lord in terms ofyour obedience to Adam (and that which ye hide) of this obedience. It is also said that this refers to whatSatan disclosed and kept hidden from them.
2|34|(And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam), a prostration of salutation, (theyfell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride) to follow his Lord's command. (And so became adisbeliever) after this because he refused to comply with Allah's command. It is also said that it was inAllah's foreknowledge that Satan was to become a disbeliever; as it is said that he was the first unbelieverever.
2|35|Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned the story of Adam and Eve, saying: (And We said: O Adam! Dwell thouand thy wife in the Garden) enter you and Eve into Paradise (and eat ye freely (of the fruits)) withoutrestriction (thereof where ye will) and whenever you will; (but come not near this tree) but do not eat fromthis tree, the tree of knowledge, which includes all types and kinds (lest ye become of the wrong-doers), lestyou harm yourselves.
2|36|(But the Devil caused them to deflect), caused them to slip (therefrom), from Paradise, (and expelled themfrom the state in which they were), from the comfort which they had enjoyed; (and We said) to Adam, Eve,the peacock and the serpent (Fall down) go down to the earth, (one of you a foe unto the other! There shallbe for you on earth a habitation), a dwelling-place, (and a provision), a benefit and livelihood, (for a time)until the moment of death.
2|37|(Then Adam received from his Lord) Adam learnt from his Lord, and it is said that he was taught andinspired with (words) so that they became a way for him and his progeny to repentance, (and He relentedtowards him), He forgave him. (Indeed! He is the Relenting), the One Who overlooks misdeeds, (theMerciful) towards any that dies repentant.
2|38|(We said) to Adam, Eve, the serpent, the peacock and Satan: (Go down) from heaven, (all of you). ThenAllah, Exalted is He, mentioned Adam's progeny, (from hence; but verily there cometh unto you), when andwhenever it comes to you, (from Me a guidance), a scripture and an emissary; (whoso followeth Myguidance) the scripture and the emissary, (there shall no fear come upon them) regarding any torment inthe future, (neither shall they grieve) about what they have left behind them. It is also said that this meansthat no fear will come upon them perpetually and nor will they grieve perpetually; no fear will come uponthem when death is slain and they will not grieve when hell is closed.
2|39|(But those who disbelieve, and deny our revelations), the scripture and the Emissary, (such are rightfulowners of the Fire), the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein forever), they will remain perpetually inhell: never to die or be released from it.
2|40|Allah then mentioned His blessings upon the Children of Israel, saying: (O Children of Israel!) O Children ofJacob, (Remember My favour), be thankful and grateful for my blessings (wherewith I favoured you), Ifavoured you with the Scripture and the emissary, escape from Pharaoh and from drowning as well assending you honey and quails and other blessings, (and fulfil My covenant) fulfil my covenant regarding thisProphet (pbuh) (I shall fulfil your covenant), by admitting you to Paradise, (and fear Me) as regards thebreaking of this covenant and do not fear anyone save Me.
2|41|(And believe in that which I revealed) through the Archangel Gabriel, (confirming) the Oneness of Allah andthe description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh) and some prescribed laws (that which ye possess already) ofscripture, (and be not first to disbelieve therein) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and part not with Myrevelations) by not revealing the description and traits of Muhammad (for a trifling price) in exchange formeans of substance, (and keep your duty unto Me), fear Me regarding this Prophet (pbuh).
2|42|(Confound not truth with falsehood), do not mix the Truth with falsehood, i.e. the description of the anti-Christ with the description of Muhammad (pbuh) (nor knowingly conceal the Truth), nor conceal the Truthwhile you know what is the Truth.
2|43|Allah then proceeded to mention the necessity of observing the law once they had become believers, saying:(And establish prayer) fulfil completely the five prescribed prayers, (pay the poor-due), pay the poor-duefrom your wealth, (and bow your heads with those who bow), pray the five prescribed prayers incongregation with Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions.
2|44|Then He mentioned the story of the Jewish leaders, saying: (Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind), do youenjoin the Oneness of Allah and the following of Muhammad (pbuh) upon people of humble background(while ye yourself forget), while you yourself refrain from following him? (And you are readers of theScripture!) to them. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not possess the common sense possessed by humanbeings?
2|45|(And seek help in patience and prayer) in performing the obligations prescribed by Allah and abstaining fromtransgression; (for truly it), the prayer (is hard) heavy (save for the humble-minded,
2|46|who know that they will have to meet their Lord) see Him, (and that unto Him they are returning) after theydie.
2|47|Then He also mentioned His blessings upon the Children of Israel, saying: (O Children of Israel!), O Childrenof Jacob! (Remember My favour), recollect my blessings (wherewith I favoured you) with the scripture, theMessenger and Islam (and how I preferred you to the worlds) sought you in preference to the other peoplesof your time.
2|48|(And guard yourselves against a day), and if you do not believe and repent of Judaism, then fear thetorment of a day (when no soul will in anything avail another), no unbelieving soul will avail anotherunbelieving soul, (nor will intercession be accepted from it) and no intercessor will be allowed to intercede,(nor will compensation be received from it) and no ransom accepted, (neither will they be helped) to avoidAllah's chastisement.
2|49|(And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk), from Pharaoh and his people, (who wereafflicting you with dreadful torment), and here Allah mentions the torment He sent on them: (slaying yoursons) in their tender years (and sparing), using (your women) who were of age: (That was a tremendoustrial from your Lord), a tremendous calamity from your Lord; and it is also said this means: a tremendousblessing.
2|50|Then Allah mentioned the favour of saving them from drowning and the drowning of Pharaoh and his folk,saying (And when We brought you through) split (the sea and rescued you) from drowning,(and drownedthe folk of Pharaoh) and his folk (in your sight) while you were looking at them, three days later.
2|51|(And when We appointed for Moses forty nights) by giving him the scripture, (and then you chose the calf),you worshipped the calf, (when he had gone from you) to the mountain, (and you were wrong-doers)harmful both to yourselves and others.
2|52|(Then, even after that), after you worshipped the calf, (We pardoned you), left you alone and did notexterminate you (in order that ye might give thanks), so that you might give thanks to Us for pardoning you.
2|53|(And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture), the Torah, (and the Criterion) i.e. We showed in it the lawfuland the unlawful, the commands and the prohibitions, as well as other things; it is also said that this means:triumph over Pharaoh, (that you might be led rightfully) guided to avoid error.
2|54|Allah then mentioned the story of Moses with his people, saying: (And when Moses said unto his people: Omy people! Ye have wronged yourselves) harmed yourselves (by your choosing of the calf) by worshippingthe calf; and when Moses was then asked what to do, he said to them: (so turn in penitence to yourCreator), again they asked him how to turn in penitence to Allah, and he said: (and kill (the guilty) amongyourselves) let those who did not worship the calf kill those who worshipped it. (That) penitence and killing(will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent towards you) He will forgive you. (Lo! He is theRelenting) towards the penitent, (the Merciful) towards any that die repentant.
2|55|(And when you said: O Moses! We will not believe in you) in what you say (till we see Allah plainly) until wesee Him plainly as you did; (and even while you gazed the lightning seized you) the Fire burnt you while youwere looking at it.
2|56|(Then We revived you) We brought you back to life (after your death) after burning you, (that ye might givethanks) that you might give thanks that I brought you back to life.
2|57|(And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you) in the wilderness (and sent down on you honey andquails) also in the wilderness, (Eat of the good things) of the lawful things (wherewith We have providedyou) that We have given you and do not keep any provision for future days. Yet they did save food forfuture days-(They wronged us not) by saving food, (but they did wrong themselves) they harmedthemselves.
2|58|(And when We said: Go into this township) the village of Jericho (Ariha) (and eat freely of that which istherein) whenever you will, (and enter the gate prostrate, and say: "Repentance".) i.e. say: "forgive oursins"; as it is also said that this means: say: "there is no god save Allah"; (We will forgive your sins andincrease for the right-doers) increase their good deeds.
2|59|(But those who did wrong) to themselves, and these are the people who said: "Repentance" (changed theword which had been told them for another word) they disobeyed the command and said "Wheat!", (and Wesent down upon the evil-doers) who changed the word they were ordered to say (wrath) the plague (fromHeaven for their evildoing) for changing the commands they were ordered to fulfil.
2|60|(And when Moses asked for water for his people) in the wilderness, (We said: smite with your staff the rock)that you have with you. This was a rock given to him by Allah. It had 12 nipples that resemble the nipples ofwomen and upon striking each one of these a spring gushed therefrom. (And there gushed out therefromtwelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking place) each tribe knew their own spring. Allah said tothem: (Eat) the honey and quails (and drink of) all the springs (that which Allah hath provided. And do notact corruptly, making mischief in the earth) and do not cause mischief on the earth, or act contrary to whatMoses commanded.
2|61|(And when you said: O Moses! We will not endure one kind of food) we will not endure eating just honeyand quails; (so pray unto your Lord) ask your Lord (for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earthgroweth of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He) i.e. Moses (said: Wouldyou exchange that which is higher) i.e. that which is better and more honourable: honey and quails (for thatwhich is lower) that which is much worse: lentils and onions? (Go down to any city) where you came from;and it is also said that this means any city, (thus you shall get that which you demand) what you haverequested is to be found there. (And humiliation) the capitation tax (and wretchedness) the attire of poverty(were stamped upon them) were imposed on them (and they were visited with wrath from Allah) as theydeserved to be forsaken by Allah. (That) being forsaken by Allah and visited by humiliation andwretchedness (was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations) they disbelieved in Muhammad (pbuh)and in the Qur'an (and slew the prophets wrongfully) without any right and for no crime whatsoever. (That)Allah's wrath (was for their disobedience) on the Sabbath (and transgression) slaying the prophets anddeclaring transgressions to be lawful.
2|62|Then Allah went on to mention the believers among them, saying: (Lo! Those who believe) in Moses and allthe other prophets, these earn their reward from their Lord in Paradise; they shall have no fear perpetuallyand they shall perpetually not grieve. It is said that this means that no fear will come upon them concerningtorment in the future life nor will they grieve about anything they have left behind. And it is also said thatthis means: they shall have no fear when death is slain and hell is closed. Then He mentioned those who didnot believe in Moses or the other prophets, saying: (and those who are Jews) who deviated from the religionof Moses, (and Christians) those who became Christians (and Sabaeans) a Christian sect whose membersshave the middle of their heads, read the Gospel, worship the angels and say: "our hearts have returned(saba'at) unto Allah", (whoever believeth) from amongst them (in Allah and the Last Day and does right) inthat which is between them and their Lord, (surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fearcome upon them neither shall they grieve).
2|63|Allah then mentions the covenant He undertook with them, saying (And when We made a covenant withyou) took your consent (and caused the Mount to tower above you) pulled out and fixed high above yourheads the mountain for taking the covenant: (Hold fast that which We have given you) comply with whatWe have given of the scripture in earnestness and diligence, (and remember that which is therein) of rewardand chastisement, and recollect what is in it of the lawful and unlawful, (that ye may ward off (evil)) in orderthat you may ward off Allah's wrath and torment and so that you may obey Him.
2|64|(Then, even after that, you turned away) you turned your back on the covenant, (and if it had not been forthe grace of Allah upon you) by deferring His punishment (and His mercy) by sending Muhammad (pbuh) toyou (you had been among the losers) you would have among the duped who are exposed to Allah'spunishment.
2|65|(And ye know) you indeed know and heard about the punishment (of those of you who broke) who havetaken the covenant (the Sabbath) the day of Saturday and this at the time of David (pbuh) (how We saidunto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated!) turned into humiliated and base apes.
2|66|(And We made it) turning them into apes (an example) we subjected them to a chastisement (to their own)for the sins they had committed before, (and) made them a lesson (to succeeding generations) in order thatthey do not follow their example (and admonition to the God-fearing) and a counsel and warning to thosewho fear Allah, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions.
2|67|Allah then mentions the story of the cow, saying: (And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allahcommandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow) any cow, (they said: Dost thou make game of us?) are you reallymocking us? (He) Moses (answered: Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish!) God forbid that I evermock the believers.
2|68|When they realised he was truthful, (They said: Pray for us unto your Lord That He make clear to us whatshe is) whether the cow is large or small. (Moses answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither old norimmature; (she is) between the two conditions) neither large nor small; (so do that which ye arecommanded) and ask no further questions.
2|69|(They said: Pray for us unto your Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is) what colour the cowis. ((Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Surely she is a yellow cow) her hoofs and horns are yellow while herbody is black. (Bright is her colour) her colour is light, (gladdening beholders) pleasing those who look ather.
2|70|(They said: pray for us unto your Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is) whether she ploughs thesoil or not. (Lo! Cows are much alike to us) we cannot distinguish much between cows; (and lo! If Allahwills, we may be led rightfully) to its fitting description; as it is said that this means: we may be led to themurder of 'Amil.
2|71|((Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Surely she is a cow unyoked) unfettered; (she plougheth not the soil) sheis not subjugated for the ploughing of the soil (nor watereth the tilth) nor for carrying water to irrigate it;(whole) free from any blemish (and without mark) spots or flecks of white. (They said: now thou bringestthe Truth) now we know the cow's right description. They looked for it and bought her in exchange for herweight in gold. (So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not) i.e. initially; as it is said because the cowwas hugely expensive.
2|72|Then Allah mentioned the murdered person, saying: (And (remember) when ye slew a man) 'Amil (anddisagreed concerning it) concerning his murder (and Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding) thusdemonstrating what you hid with regard to his murder.
2|73|(And We said: Smite him) the murdered person (with some of it) with an organ of the cow; and it is alsosaid: with its tail or tongue. (Thus) just as He brought 'Amil back to life (Allah bringeth the dead to life) forthe Resurrection (and showeth you His portents) bringing the dead to life (so that ye may understand) inorder that you may believe in resurrection after death.
2|74|(Then, even after that) after bringing 'Amil back to life and informing you about his murderer, (your heartswere hardened) dry and barren (and became as rocks, or worse than rock, for hardness. For indeed thereare rocks from out which rivers gush, and indeed there are some which split asunder so that water flowethfrom them. And indeed there are some which fall down) from the top of mountains to the bottom (for thefear of Allah) but your hearts are not moved by fear of Allah. (Allah is not unaware of) will not leaveunpunished (what ye do) of transgressions; and it is said the meaning is: what you hide of transgression.
2|75|(Have ye any hope that they will be true to you) do you hope, O Muhammad, that the Jews will believe inyou (when a party of them) the 70 men who were with Moses (used to listen to the Word of Allah) used tolisten to Moses reciting the Word of Allah, (then used to change it) alter it, (after they had understood it)after knowing it and fully understanding it (knowingly?) while knowing that they were altering it?
2|76|Then Allah mentioned the hypocrites of the people of the Book, and it is also said that the reference here isto the lowly from among the people of the Book, saying: (And when they fall with those who believe) AbuBakr and his companions, (they say: We believe) in your Prophet, and his description and traits arementioned in our Book. (But when they go apart one with another) when these lowly people return to theirleaders (they say) the leaders say to the lowly: (Prate ye to them) i.e. Muhammad and his Companions (ofthat which Allah hath disclosed to you) about that which Allah has shown you regarding the description andtraits of Muhammad in your Book (so that they may contend with you) argue against you (before your Lordconcerning it? Have ye then no sense?) do you not have any common sense?
2|77|Allah, Exalted is He, says: (Are they) i.e. these leaders (then unaware that Allah knoweth that which theykeep hidden) amongst themselves (and that which they proclaim?) to Muhammad and his Companions.
2|78|(Among them are unlettered folk who know not the scripture) they do not know how to read or write it(except from hearsay) except the unfounded things they hear. (They but guess) their talk is all surmisebased on what they heard from their leaders.
2|79|(Therefore woe) severe punishment, and it is said this means: a valley in hell (be unto those who write theScripture with their hands) change the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Book (and thensay, "This is) in the Book that has come (from Allah", that they may purchase) through changing andaltering it (a small gain therewith) a small gain in terms of means of subsistence and surplus of property.(Woe unto them) theirs is a severe punishment (for what their hands have written) have altered (and woeunto them) and theirs is a severe punishment (for what they earn thereby) of unlawful earnings and bribes.
2|80|(And they say) i.e. the Jews: (Hellfire will not touch us save for a certain number of days) only for 40 days,the number of days in which our forefathers worshipped the calf. (Say) O Muhammad: (Have ye received acovenant from Allah) for what you are saying-(truly Allah will not break His covenant) if indeed you have acovenant with Allah-(or tell ye) or do you indeed tell (concerning Allah that which ye know not?) that whichyou know does not exist in your Book?
2|81|(Nay) here Allah answers the Jews, (but whoever hath done evil) ascribes partners to Allah (and his sinssurround him) and dies ascribing partners to Allah; (such are) those who have these attributes (rightfulowners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell; (they will abide therein forever) perpetually, they will neither die norleave it.
2|82|Allah then mentions the believers, saying: (And those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and dogood works) acts of obedience that are between them and their Lord, (such are rightful owners of Paradise.They will abide therein forever) perpetually, they will never die or come out of it.
2|83|Allah then mentions His covenant with the Children of Israel, saying: (And when We made a covenant withthe Children of Israel: Worship none save Allah) declare Him as the only true God and do not ascribe anypartner to Him, (and be good to parents) be dutiful to them (and to kindred) and keep contact with relatives(and to orphans) and be kind to orphans (and the needy) and generous to the needy, (and speak kindly tomankind) say the Truth regarding Muhammad (pbuh); (and establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers(and pay the poor-due) and give from your wealth what is due to the poor. (Then, after that, ye slid back)you turned back on this covenant, (save a few of you) from amongst your forefathers; as it is said that thisrefers to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (being averse) denying and leaving it aside.
2|84|(And when We made with you a covenant) in the Book: (shed not the blood of your people) do not kill oneanother (nor turn your people) i.e. one another (out of your dwellings) from your homes, meaning: the BanuQurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir. (Then ye ratified (Our covenant)) you agreed to it (and ye were witnesses(thereto)) while knowing what you were doing.
2|85|(Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting oneanother against them by sin) contravention (and transgression) offence-(and if they came to you ascaptives) captives who belong to your religion (ye would ransom them) free them by paying a ransom to theenemy (-whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you) whereas their expulsion and killing wereunlawful in the first place. (Believe ye in part of the Scripture) the part that stipulates freeing your captivesfrom the enemy (and disbelieve ye in part thereof?) and leave the captives of your friends withoutransoming them. It is also said that this verse means: do you believe in those parts of the scripture that suityour whim and disbelieve in those parts that do not? (And what is the reward of those who do so saveignominy in the life of the world) by being killed or captured as slaves, (and on the Day of Resurrection theywill be consigned to the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware) He is not reducing your punishmentbecause (of what ye do) in terms of transgression; and it is also said: because of what they concealed.
2|86|(Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter) they choose this lower worldinstead of the Hereafter, and disbelief instead of belief: (Their punishment will not be lightened) will not bereduced; as it is said: it will not be lifted, (neither will they have support) be precluded from Allah'schastisement.
2|87|(And surely, We gave unto Moses the Scripture) the Torah (and We caused a train of messengers to followafter him) to come after him in succession, (and We gave unto Jesus son of Mary clear proofs) commands,prohibitions, wondrous things and signs, (and We supported him) strengthened and helped him (with theholy Spirit) with Gabriel, the purified. (Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you) O group of Jews (amessenger with that which ye yourselves desire not) which does not agree with your hearts and religion, (yegrow arrogant) you disdain believing in him. (And some ye disbelieve) you disbelieve in a group of them,namely Muhammad and Jesus, Allah bless them and give them peace (and some ye slay?) and some youkilled, namely, John the Baptist and Zachariah.
2|88|(And they say) i.e. the Jews: (Our hearts are hardened) vis-�-vis what you say, O Muhammad, i.e. ourhearts are capable of absorbing any knowledge, but they prove incapable of comprehending your knowledgeor what you say. (Nay) this is a reply to them, (but Allah hath cursed them) sealed their hearts (for theirdisbelief) as a punishment for their disbelief. (Little is that which they believe) they believe neither much nora little; it is also said that this means: they do not believe in what you say at all.
2|89|(And when there cometh unto them a Scripture from Allah, confirming that in their possession) whichaccords with that which is in their possession (though before that) before Muhammad (pbuh) (they wereasking for a signal triumph) through Muhammad and the Qur'an (over those who disbelieved) of theirenemies: the tribes of Asad, Ghatafan, Muzaynah, and Juhaynah (and when there cometh unto them thatwhich they knew) of his traits and description in their Book (they disbelieved therein) they denied it washim. (The curse of Allah) His wrath and torment (is on disbelievers) the Jews.
2|90|(Evil is that which they sold their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed) theBook and the Messenger, (grudging) resentfully envious (that Allah should reveal of His bounty) that out ofHis bounty, Allah sent Gabriel with the Book and prophethood (unto whom He will of His bondmen) meaningMuhammad. (They have incurred anger upon anger) they deserved curse upon curse. (For disbelievers is ashameful doom) through which they shall be humiliated; and it is said: theirs is a severe punishment.
2|91|(And when it is said unto them) i.e. the Jews: (Believe in that which Allah hath revealed) meaning: theQur'an, (they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us) i.e. the Torah. (And they disbelieve inthat which cometh after it) other than the Torah, (though it is the Truth) i.e. the Qur'an is the Truth(confirming) affirming the Oneness of Allah (that which they possess) of the Book. They said: "OMuhammad! Our forefathers were believers". (Say) O Muhammad!: (Why then slew ye the Prophets of Allahbefore, if ye are (indeed) believers?) if your claims are truthful.
2|92|(And Moses came unto you with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and signs (yet while he wasaway ye chose the calf) you worshipped the calf (and ye were wrong-doers) unbelievers.
2|93|(And when We made with you a covenant) when we took your consent (and caused the Mount to towerabove you) extracted it, elevated it and fixed it above your heads: (Hold fast by that which We have givenyou) be diligent and earnest with what We have given you of the Book, (and hear) obey what you havebeen commanded, (they said: We hear and rebel) it is as if they were saying: if it were not for the mountainwe would have heard your saying and disobeyed your command. (And (worship of) the calf was made tosink into their hearts) their love of worshipping the calf sank into their hearts (because of their rejection) asa punishment for their disbelief. (Say (unto them)) O Muhammad! If love of worshipping the calf is equal inyour eyes to love of your Creator, then: (Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you) the worship of thecalf enjoins on you, (if ye are believers) if you are truthful that your forefathers were believers.
2|94|(Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise (in the providence of Allah is indeed for youalone) specifically for you alone (and not for others of mankind) and not for the believers in Muhammad andhis Companions ((as you pretend), then long for death (for ye must long for death)) ask for death (if ye aretruthful) in your claim.
2|95|(But they will never long for it) they will never ask for death, (because of that which their own hands havesent before them) because of what they themselves have done in the religion of Judaism. (And Allah isAware of evil-doers) i.e. the Jews.
2|96|(And thou) O Muhammad! (wilt find them) the Jews (greediest of mankind for any life) to remain in thisworld (and (greedier) than the idolaters) even greedier than the Arab idolaters. ((Each) one of them wouldlike) would hope (to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (that long) would by no means removehim) save him (from the doom) if he were to live a thousand years. (And Allah is Seer of what they do) ofcontraventions, rebellion and what they conceal about the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh).
2|97|Then Allah, Exalted is He, revealed the following verse about the saying of one of the Jews, 'Abdullah IbnSuriyyah, that Gabriel was the enemy of the Jews, saying: (Say) O Muhammad!: (Who is an enemy toGabriel!) is automatically an enemy to Allah. (For he it is who hath revealed to your heart) sent Gabriel toyou with the Qur'an (by Allah's leave) by Allah's command, (confirming) affirming the Oneness of Allah (thatwhich was before it) of the Book, (and a guidance) from error (and glad tiding) good news (to believers)that Paradise will be theirs.
2|98|(Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His Messengers, and Gabriel and Michael! Then, Lo! Allah(Himself) is an enemy to disbelievers) to the Jews, just as Gabriel, Michael and all the believers are enemiesof the Jews.
2|99|(Verily We have revealed unto thee) sent you Gabriel with (clear tokens) with manifest signs expoundingcommands and prohibitions, (and only miscreants) the unbelievers and the Jews (will disbelieve in them) willdeny the signs.
2|100|(Is it ever so that when they make a covenant) i.e. the Jewish leaders with Muhammad (a party of them setit aside?) reject and break it. (The truth is, most of them) all of them in fact (believe not).
2|101|(And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming) conforming in traits anddescription (that which they possess) of the Book, (a party of those who have received the Scripture flingthe Scripture of Allah) i.e. the Torah (behind their backs) disbelieving in what it contains of the traits anddescription of Muhammad (pbuh) nor did they exposit this (as if they knew not) as if they were ignorantpeople who knew nothing.
2|102|The Jews left the guidance of all the prophets (And they followed that which the devils falsely related) theyacted upon what the devils had written (against the kingdom of Solomon) about the collapse of Solomon'skingdom, and 40 days of sorcery and white magic. (Solomon disbelieved not) did not write this sorcery andwhite magic; (but the devils disbelieved) did write it, (teaching mankind) the devils taught people, as it issaid that the Jews taught people (magic and that which was revealed to the two angels) but the angels werenot taught sorcery and white magic; and it is said that this means: they also taught what the angels wereinspired with (in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they teach it to anyone) nor did the angels describeanything to anyone (till they had said) at the outset: (We are only a temptation) we have been tried withcalling people to this in order that we reduce the intensity of the torment inflicted on ourselves, (thereforedisbelieve not) do not learn or act upon it. (And from these two (angels) people learn) without being taughtby them (that by which they cause division between man and wife) that by which a man finds excuse toleave his wife; (but they injure thereby) with sorcery and causing rift (no one save by Allah's leave) exceptthrough Allah's will and with His knowledge. (And they learn) the devils, the Jews and sorcerers learn fromeach other (that which harms them) in the Hereafter (and profits them not) in this world or the next. (Andsurely they do know) this refers to the angels, and it is said that it refers to the Jews in their Book, as it issaid that his refers to the devils (that he who trafficketh therein) chooses sorcery and white magic (will haveno (happy) portion in the Hereafter) in Paradise; (and surely evil is the price for which they sold their souls)by choosing sorcery for themselves, and the reference here is to the Jews, (if they but knew) but they donot know; and it is said that this means: and they did know this from their own Book.
2|103|(And if they) i.e. the Jews (had believed) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and kept from evil) repented fromJudaism and sorcery, (a recompense from Allah) a reward from Allah (would be better) than Judaism andsorcery, (if they only knew) if they believed in Allah's reward, but they do not know nor do they believe; andit is said that they knew all this from their Book.
2|104|Then Allah mentions His prohibition to the believers not to use the same vocabulary used by the Jews,saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say not) to Muhammad: ("Listen to us") lend usyour ear (but say "Look upon us,") look at us and hear us, and it is for this reason that Allah forbade thebelievers to use the Jews' vocabulary (and be ye listeners) to what you have been commanded to do andobey. (For disbelievers) for the Jews (is a painful doom) which will extend to their hearts.
2|105|(Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture) Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions(nor the idolaters) the idolaters of Arabia: Abu Jahl and his companions (love that there should be sentdown unto you) that Allah should send Gabriel unto your Prophet (any good thing) the good of prophethood,Islam and the Book (from your Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy) chooses for His religion,prophethood, Islam and the Book (whom He will) whoever deserves to be chosen, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh)(and Allah is of infinite mercy) His favour in giving Muhammad prophethood and Islam is great indeed.
2|106|Then Allah mentions what was abrogated of the Qur'an and that which was not abrogated, as a directreference to the claim of the Quraysh who said to the Prophet: O Muhammad! Why do you command us todo something and then forbid it, saying: (Such of Our revelations as We abrogate) We do not erase a versethat was acted upon before and which is now not acted upon (or cause to be forgotten) or leaveunabrogated so that it is acted upon, (We bring one better) We send Gabriel with that which more profitableand easier to act upon (or the like) in reward, benefit and action. (Knowest thou not) O Muhammad (thatAllah is Able to do all things?) of the abrogated and unabrogated.
2|107|(Knowest thou not) O Muhammad (that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens andthe earth) the stores of the heavens and earth; He commands His servants with whatever He wills becauseHe knows better what is good for them; (and ye have not) O Jews, (apart from Allah) from Allah's torment,(any friend) anyone close to benefit or protect you (or helper?) anyone that can prevent your punishment.
2|108|(Or would ye question your messenger) ask him to see your Lord, hear His speech and other similar things(as Moses was questioned) as the Children of Israel asked Moses (before) before the advent of Muhammad(pbuh)? (He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road) he hasrelinquished the path of guidance.
2|109|(Many of the people of the Scripture) Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions and Finhas Ibn 'Azurah and hiscompanions (long to make you disbelievers) make you abandon your Religion and become unbelievers, O'Ammar [Ibn Yasir], Hudhayfah [Ibn al-Yaman] and Mu'adh Ibn Jabal! (after your belief) in Muhammad andthe Qur'an, (through envy of their own account) through resentful envy, (after the Truth hath becomemanifest unto them) in their Book that Muhammad and his Book, his description and traits, are true, (Soforgive) leave them (and be indulgent) shun them (until Allah giveth command) brings His chastisementupon Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir, through killing, captivity and expulsion. (Lo! Allah is Able to do allthings) to cause their death and expulsion.
2|110|(And establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers, (and pay the poor-due) pay the poor what is due fromyour wealth; (and whatever of good) of righteous deeds, and the poor-due and charitable works (ye sendbefore for your souls) you save for yourselves, (ye will find it) you will find its reward (with Allah) from Allah.(Lo! Allah is Seer) knows your intentions (of what ye do) of what you spend in charity and the poor-due.
2|111|(And they say) i.e. the Jews: (None entereth Paradise unless he be a Jew) unless he dies as a Jew, allegedly(or a Christian) as the Christians also claimed. (These are their own desires) what they wish from Allah eventhough it is not in their Books. (Say) O Muhammad, to both parties: (Bring your proofs) from your ownrespective Books (if ye are truthful) in your claim.
2|112|(Nay) it is certainly not as you have claimed, (but whoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah) whoevermakes sincere his Religion and works to Allah (while doing good) in words and deeds, (his reward is with hisLord) in Paradise; (and there shall no fear come upon them) about staying eternally in hell (neither shallthey grieve) about the prospect of missing Paradise.
2|113|Allah then mentions the claims of the Jews and Christians that their respective religion is the true Religion,saying: (And Jews) the Jews of Medina (say Christians follow nothing) as religion from God and there is notrue religion except Judaism, (and Christians) the Christians of Najran (say Jews follow nothing) as religionfrom God and there is no true religion except Christianity; (though both are readers of the Scripture) bothparties read the Book and do not believe in it and further claim things that are not mentioned therein. (Eventhus spoke those who know not) knew the Oneness of Allah through their own forefathers; and it is said thismeans: they knew the Book of Allah from others. (Allah will judge between them) between the Jews andChristians (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ).
2|114|Then He mentioned Tatus Ibn Asipanos al-Rumi, king of the Christians who destroyed Jerusalem, saying:(And who doth greater wrong) in his disbelief (than he who forbideth the approach to the sanctuaries ofAllah) Jerusalem (lest His name should be mentioned therein) by declaring Allah's Oneness and calling toprayer, (and striveth for their ruin?) in the ruin of Jerusalem by throwing carrions in it. And this lasted untilthe reign of 'Umar. (As for such) for the Romans, (it was never meant that they should enter them)Jerusalem (except in fear) hiding from the believers for fear of being killed, for they would be killed if found.(Theirs in the world is ignominy) a chastisement in that their cities, Constantinople, Amorium ('Ammuriyyah)and Rome (Rumiyyah) would be ruined (and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom) more severe than thepunishment they were subjected to in this world.
2|115|Then Allah mentioned the direction of prayer to Him, saying (Unto Allah belong the East and the West) as adirection of prayer for him who does not know the correct direction of prayer, (and whithersoever ye turn)your faces in prayer after ascertaining the direction, (there is Allah's Countenance) that prayer is performedin Allah's pleasure. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who prayedwhilst travelling in the wrong direction after doing their best to determine the correct direction. It is also saidthat saying (Unto Allah belong the East and the West) means: the people of the East and the people of theWest have one direction of prayer which is the Sacred Precinct, and therefore (there is Allah's Countenance)means: that is the direction of prayer to Allah, (Lo! Allah is All-Embracing) regarding the direction of prayer,(All- Knowing) of their intentions.
2|116|Then Allah mentions the claims of the Jews and Christians that Ezra and Jesus are the sons of Allah, saying:(And they) the Jews and Christians (say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a Son) Ezra and the Messiah (Jesus).(Be He glorified!) He is far exalted to have a son or partner (Nay) it is not as they say, (but whatsoever is inthe heavens and the earth) of creation (is His) are His servants. (All are subservient unto Him) linked to Himby the bond of servitude and the declaration of His Oneness.
2|117|(The Originator of the heavens and the earth!) He originated them when they were nothing before. (WhenHe decreeth a thing) when He wants to create a child without a father, like Jesus, (He saith unto it only:Be!) be a child without a father, just like Adam was without a father or mother, (And it is).
2|118|(And those who have no knowledge) who do not know the Oneness of Allah, i.e. the Jews (say: Why dothnot Allah speak unto us) directly, (or some sign come unto us) a sign confirming the prophethood ofMuhammad (pbuh); for then, we would surely believe? (Even thus, as they now speak, spoke) similar words(those before them) their forefathers. (Their hearts are all alike) their words and hearts are the same. (Wehave made clear the revelations) the signs: the commands, prohibitions and your traits in the Torah (forpeople who are sure) who believe.
2|119|(Lo! We have sent thee) O Muhammad (with the Truth) with the Qur'an and the declaration of the Onenessof Allah, (a bringer of glad tidings) that Paradise shall be for the believers (and a warner) against hell forthose who disbelieve in Allah. (And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hellfire) it is not befitting thatyou should ask about the dwellers of hell; and it is said that this means: do not ask for the forgiveness ofthe dwellers of hell.
2|120|(And Jews) The Jews of Medina (will not be pleased with thee, nor will Christians) the Christians of Najran,(till thou follow their creed) their religion and direction of prayer. (Say) O Muhammad! (Lo! The guidance ofAllah is Guidance) the Religion of Allah is Islam and Allah's direction of prayer is the Ka'bah. (And if thoushouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath comeunto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka'bah, (then wouldst thouhave from Allah) from His chastisement (no protecting friend) no one to benefit you (nor helper) to save youfrom this chastisement.
2|121|Allah then mentioned the believers from among the people of the Book: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and hiscompanions, Bahirah the Monk and the Negus and his followers, saying: (Those unto whom We have giventhe Scripture) given knowledge of the Scripture, i.e. the Torah, (who read it with the right reading) describeit as it is and do not alter it: expositing what is lawful and unlawful, its commands and prohibitions towhomever asks them, and they further act according to what is clear and unambiguous and believe in thatwhich is ambiguous therein, (those believe in it) in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (And who disbelieveth in it)in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (those are they who are losers) who are duped in that they lose both thisworld and the world to come.
2|122|Allah then mentions His favour upon the Children of Israel, saying: (O Children of Israel!) O Children ofJacob (Remember) recollect (My favour wherewith I favoured you) favoured your forefathers by deliveringthem from Pharaoh and his people as well as by the blessings and bounties that I favoured them with (andhow I preferred you) with Islam (to the worlds) the people of your time.
2|123|(And guard against a day) fear the torment of a day, i.e. the Day of Judgement (when no soul will inanything avail another) no unbelieving soul will be able to drive away anything from another unbelievingsoul; it is also said that this means: no righteous soul will be able to drive away anything from anotherrighteous soul; and it is said that this means: no father will be able to drive away anything from his son andno son will be able to drive away Allah's punishment from his father, (nor will compensation be acceptedfrom it) no ransom will be accepted, (nor will intercession be of use to it) no intercessor will intercede for it:not a close angel, a sent messenger or a righteous servant; (nor will they be helped) will be prevented fromwhat they will face.
2|124|Allah then mentioned His favour upon Abraham, His close friend, saying: (And when his Lord tried Abrahamwith some words) He commanded him to fulfil ten traits: five in relation to his head and five to his body,(and he fulfilled them) he complied. It is also said that (And when his Lord tried Abraham with some words)means: with every single word he prayed to Allah, (He said) to him: (Lo! I have appointed you a leader formankind) a vicegerent that people may emulate you. (He) Abraham (said: And of my offspring) make of myoffspring vicegerents that people would emulate? (He) Allah (said: My covenant) with you and My promiseto you and the honour and mercy I bestowed upon you (includeth not wrong-doers) from among youroffspring; it is also said that this means: My covenant will not include the wrong-doers in the Hereafter but itwill include them in this life.
2|125|Allah then commanded people to emulate him, saying: (And when We made the House a resort) a place toturn to (for mankind) whereby they can turn and long for (and a sanctuary) for whoever enters it: (Take) it,O community of Muhammad! (as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to pray)) a placewhereby you turn in prayer. (And We imposed a duty upon) commanded (Abraham and Ishmael: Purify Myhouse) from idols (for those who go around and those who meditate therein) those who live there (andthose who bow down and prostrate themselves) those who perform the five daily prayers, regardless of theircountry of origin.
2|126|(And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security) free of perturbation (and bestow uponits people fruits) different kinds of fruit, (such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day) in resurrectionafter death, (He) Allah (answered: As for him who disbelieveth) as well, (I shall leave him in contentment fora while) I shall provide for him a little in this life, (then I shall compel him) force him (to the doom of fire, ahapless journey's end!) to which he shall come.
2|127|(And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundation of the House) built the foundation of theHouse and Ishmael was helping him and when they finished, they prayed: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Acceptfrom us) the building of Your house. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer) of our prayer, (the Knower) ofthe answer to this prayer; it is also said that this means: the Knower of our intention in building Your house.
2|128|(Our Lord!) O our Lord! (And make us submissive) obedient and sincere (unto Thee) by not ascribing anypartners to you and through worshipping You (and of our seed a nation submissive) obedient and sincere(unto Thee) by not ascribing any partners to you and through worshipping You, (and show us our rites)teach us the rites of our pilgrimage, (and relent towards us) overlook our shortcomings. (Lo! Thou, onlyThou, art the Relenting) You who overlooks shortcomings, (the Merciful) towards the believers.
2|129|(Our Lord!) O our Lord (And raise up in their midst) the offspring of Ishmael (a Messenger from amongthem) from their own lineage (who shall recite unto them Your revelations) the Qur'an, (and shall instructthem in the Scripture) the Qur'an (and in wisdom) the lawful and the prohibited (and shall make them pure)from sins through the declaration of the Oneness of God. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty) Who isvengeful against whosoever does not answer Your Messenger whom You sent to them, (the Wise) insending the Messenger. And Allah answered his prayers and sent unto them Muhammad (pbuh); and theseare the words with which Allah tried him, and he fulfilled them by asking Allah for them in his prayer.
2|130|(And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham) renounces the Religion of Abraham and his practices (save himwho befooleth himself?) has ruined himself, lost his mind or is foolish? (Verily We chose him) i.e. Abraham(in the world) by taking him as a friend; as it is said this means: We have chosen him in this world bybestowing upon him prophethood, Islam and goodly offspring, (and lo! In the Hereafter he is among therighteous ones) with his forefathers, the messengers, in Paradise.
2|131|(When his Lord said unto him) when he came out of the pit of fire: (Surrender) say specifically: there is nogod save Allah! (He said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds) I submit to the Lord of all theworlds, and declare that Allah is the only One God, without partner. It is also said that when Abrahaminvited his people to accept that Allah is One without partners, his Lord said unto him: make your Religionand works sincere to Allah; and he answered: I make my Religion and works sincere to the Lord of theworlds. And it is also said that when Abraham was thrown in the Fire, his Lord said unto him: make yourreligion and works sincere to Allah; he replied: I comply and make my Religion and works sincere to Allah,Lord of all the worlds.
2|132|(The same did Abraham enjoin) enjoined that there is no god except Allah (upon his sons) when he wasdying, (and also Jacob) he also enjoined his children with the same: (O my sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen foryou the (true) religion) the Religion of Islam; (therefore die not save as men who have surrendered) holdfast to Islam until you die as Muslims, sincere to Him in your worship and in your declaration of divineOneness.
2|133|Then Allah mentioned the dispute among the Jews concerning the religion of Abraham, saying: (Or were yewitnesses) or were you, O assembly of Jews, present (when death came to Jacob) regarding what heenjoined his children, i.e. whether he enjoined them to follow Judaism or Islam, (when he said unto hissons: What will ye worship after me?) after I die? (They said: We shall worship thy God) we worship, (theGod of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, one God) i.e. we worship one God, (and unto Him wehave surrendered) we acknowledge to worship Him and declare that there is only one true God.
2|134|(Those are the people) a group of people (who have passed away) perished. (Theirs is that which theyearned) of goodness (and yours is that which ye earn) of goodness. (And ye will not be asked) on the Dayof Judgement (of what they used to do) or say.
2|135|Allah mentioned after this the dispute of the Jews and Christians with the believers, saying: (And they say)i.e. the Jews: (Be Jews) you shall be guided from error (or Christians) and the Christians also say the same,(then ye will be rightly guided. Say) to them, O Muhammad: it is not as you claim: (Nay, but the religion ofAbraham, the upright) the Muslim; rather follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, the Muslim, thesincere-only then you will be guided, (and he was not of the idolaters) i.e. he did not follow the religion ofthe Jews or Christians.
2|136|Then He taught the believers the path of divine Oneness so that the Jews and Christians had an indication ofwhat this divine Oneness means, saying: (Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealedunto us) i.e. in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and that which was revealed unto Abraham) i.e. we believe inAbraham and his Scripture, (and Ishmael) and we believe in Ishmael and his Scripture, (and Isaac) and inIsaac and his Scripture, (and Jacob) and in Jacob and his Scripture, (and the tribes) and in the sons of Jacoband their Scriptures, (and that which Moses and Jesus received) i.e. we believe in Moses and the Torah andin Jesus and the Gospel, (and that which the Prophets received) we also believe in all the prophets and theirScriptures (from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them) that Allah sent them as prophetsto teach divine Oneness, (and unto Him we have surrendered) we acknowledge that we worship Him anddeclare that there is only one true God.
2|137|(And if they) i.e. the people of the Book (believe in the like of that which you believe) in all the prophets andtheir Scriptures (then are they right guided) from error by following the religion of Muhammad andAbraham. (But if they turn away) refuse to believe in all the prophets and their Scriptures, (then are they inschism) in conflict with the true religion, (and Allah will suffice thee (for defence) against them) Allah will lifttheir burden from you, by killing and expelling them. (And He is the Hearer) of what they say, (the Knower)of their punishment.
2|138|((We take our) colour from Allah) i.e. follow the Religion of Allah, (and who is better than Allah at colouring)better than the Religion of Allah. (And We are His worshippers) say: we are monotheists and acknowledgethat we worship Him and declare that there is only one true God.
2|139|(Say), O Muhammad, ((unto the People of the Scripture) dispute ye with us) do you argue with us(concerning Allah) concerning the Religion of Allah (when He is our Lord and your Lord?) when Allah is ourLord and yours? (Ours are our works) we have our religion (and yours your work) your religion. (And we aresincere (in our faith) in Him) we acknowledge that we worship Him and declare that there is only one trueGod.
2|140|(Or say ye) O Jews and Christians (that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes) thechildren of Jacob (were Jews or Christians) as you claim? (Say) to them, O Muhammad! (Do ye know best,or doth Allah?) do you know best about their religion or does Allah? Allah has already informed us thatAbraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. (And who is more unjust) in his disbelief and more insolent anddaring vis-�-vis Allah (than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah) in the Torahconcerning the prophethood of this Prophet (pbuh)? (Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what ye do) aboutconcealing your testimony.
2|141|(Those are a people) a group of people (who have passed away) perished; (theirs is that which they earned)of goodness (and yours is that which ye earn) of goodness. (And ye will not be asked) on the Day ofJudgement (of what they used to do) in this world.
2|142|(The foolish of the people) the ignorant among the Jews and Arab idolaters (will say: What hath turnedthem) made them change (from the Qiblah which they formerly observed) except that they want to revert tothe religion of their ancestors; it is also said that this means: there was no reason to turn from the directionin which they prayed, i.e. Jerusalem? (Say) O Muhammad! (unto Allah belong the East) praying to theKa'bah (and the West) the prayer that you prayed in the direction of Jerusalem-both are with Allah'scommand. (He guideth whom He will unto a straight path) He confirms whom He wills on a straight Religionand direction of prayer.
2|143|(Thus) i.e. just as we have honoured you with the Religion of Abraham (Islam) and his direction of prayer(We have appointed you a middle nation) a middlemost community, (that you be witnesses) for theprophets (over mankind, and that the Messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (may be a witness over you) that youare upright and follow the straight path. (And We appointed) changed (the Qiblah which ye formerlyobserved) prayed towards for a period of 19 months (only that We might know) see and distinguish (himwho followeth the Messenger) concerning the Qiblah, (from him who turneth) reverts (on his heels) to hisformer religion and direction of prayer. (In truth it) the changing of the Qiblah (was a hard (test) save forthose whom Allah guided) whose hearts Allah had protected. (But it was not Allah's purpose that your faithshould be in vain) that He thwarts your faith as it was prior to the abrogation of legal rulings; and it is alsosaid that this means: it is not Allah's purpose to thwart your faith but rather His purpose is to abrogate thelegal rulings which conduct your faith; and it is also said that this means: Allah did not thwart your prayerstowards Jerusalem but He has abrogated the ruling which required you to pray towards Jerusalem, (for Allahis full of pity, Merciful) in that He does not thwart your faith as it was before the abrogation of legal rulings(towards mankind) towards the believers.
2|144|Allah then mentions the supplication of His Prophet regarding the changing of the Qiblah towards Mecca,saying: (We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O Muhammad)) turning your sight toheaven in anticipation of Gabriel coming down to announce the change of the Qiblah. (And now surely Weshall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a Qiblah that is dear to thee) that you like, namely, the Qiblah ofAbraham. (So turn thy face) when in prayer (towards the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims),wheresoever ye may be) whether on land or in the sea, (turn your faces (when ye pray)) in prayer (towardsit. (Lo! Those who have received the Scripture know that) the Sacred Precinct (is the Truth from their Lord)is the Qiblah of Abraham but they conceal this fact. (And Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what they do) ofwhat they conceal.
2|145|(And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all kinds of portents) all the signsthey asked of you, (they would not follow your Qiblah) they would not pray towards your Qiblah norembrace your Religion, (nor canst thou be a follower of their Qiblah) nor can you pray towards the Qiblah ofthe Jews or Christians; (nor are some of them followers of others) nor are some of them going to praytowards the Qiblah of the Jews and Christians. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) after being warnedand pray towards their Qiblah (after the knowledge which hath come unto you) that the Sacred Precinct isthe Qiblah of Abraham, (then surely) if you do that then surely (wert thou of the evil-doers) who harmthemselves.
2|146|Then Allah mentions the believers of the people of the Book, saying: (Those unto whom We gave theScripture) gave the knowledge of the Torah, 'Abdullah ibn Salam and his followers (recognise) knowMuhammad (pbuh) with his description and traits (as they recognise their children) in the midst of otherchildren. (But lo! A party of them) of the people of the Book (knowingly) knowing it to exist in their Book(conceal the Truth) conceal the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh).
2|147|(It is the Truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad)) that you are a Prophet sent by Allah. (So be not thou ofthose who waver) who doubt whether they know or not.
2|148|(And each one hath a goal) to each adherent of a religion a Qiblah (towards which he turneth) he facesaccording to his own whim; it is also said that this means: to each prophet a Qiblah, which is the Ka'bah,towards which he is ordered to face; (so vie with one another in good works) so hasten, O community ofMuhammad, to perform acts of obedience more than any other nation. (Wheresoever you may be) on landor at sea, (Allah will bring you all together) gather you together and reward you for the good works youperformed. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) like gathering you together as well as other things.
2|149|(And whencesoever you comest forth (for prayer, O Muhammad) turn thy face) in prayer (towards theInviolable Place of Worship; Lo! It) the Inviolable Place of Worship (is the Truth from your Lord) it is theQiblah of Abraham, Allah bless him. (And Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what ye do) of what youconceal about the Qiblah of Abraham and other things.
2|150|(Whencesoever thou comest forth) you are to (turn thy face) in prayer (towards the Inviolable Place ofWorship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims)) on land or at sea (turn your faces) in prayer (towards it(when ye pray) so that men) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his Companions (may have no argument against you)regarding the changing of the Qiblah because in their Scripture the Inviolable Place of Worship was theQiblah of Abraham; therefore if you pray towards it, they will have no argument against you, (save such ofthem as do injustice) nor would those who transgressed with their words have any argument against you,and these included Ka'b Ibn Ashraf and the Arab idolaters (-Fear them not) regarding the changing of theQiblah, (but fear Me) in leaving the old Qiblah (-so that I may complete My grace upon you) by giving you aQiblah just as I have completed for you your Religion, (and that you be guided) to the Qiblah of Abraham.
2|151|(Even as We have sent unto you a Messenger) remember Me as I have sent a Messenger (from among you)from your own lineage, (who reciteth unto you Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an: its commands andprohibitions (and causeth you to grow) cleanses you of sin through divine Oneness, the poor-due, and alms,(and teacheth you the Scripture) the Qur'an (and wisdom) the lawful and the prohibited, (and teacheth you)of legal rulings, legal punishments and stories of bygone nations (that which ye knew not) before therevelation of the Qur'an and the advent of Muhammad (pbuh).
2|152|(Therefore remember Me) through the performance of acts of obedience, (I will remember you) by grantingyou Paradise; and it is also said that this means: remember Me in time of ease, I will remember you in timesof hardship. (Give thanks to Me) for the blessings I bestowed upon you, (and reject not Me) do not stopgiving thanks for these blessings.
2|153|(O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness) to fulfil the obligations of Allah and to abstain fromcontraventions and shameful works (and prayer) and with abundant supererogatory prayers at night andduring the day in order to come clean from sin. (Lo! Allah is with the steadfast) He helps, and protects thesteadfast from shameful works.
2|154|Allah thereafter mentions the saying of the hypocrites apropos the martyrs of Badr, Uhud and all the otherbattles: "So-and-so has died and lost all comfort and happiness", this in order to aggravate sincere believers,and so Allah says: (And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, on the Day ofBadr or in any other battle ("dead") like any other dead people. (Nay they are living) they are rather livinglike those living in Paradise, being provided with comfort and bounties, (only ye perceive not) you are notaware of the honour bestowed upon them or of their real state.
2|155|Then He mentioned His trial to the believer, saying: (And surely We shall try you) test you (with somethingof fear) fear of the enemy (and hunger) in the years of drought, (and loss of wealth and lives) throughkilling, death and illnesses (and crops) and the loss of crops;
2|156|but then He said: (but give) O Muhammad (glad tidings to the steadfast, who say, when a misfortune) likethe ones I have mentioned (striketh them: lo! We are Allah's) we are the slaves of Allah (and lo! Unto Himwe are returning) after we die; and if we are not pleased with His decree, He will not be pleased with ourworks.
2|157|(Such) those who have these traits (are they on whom are blessings) forgiveness (from their Lord) in thisworld, (and mercy) in that they are not tormented in the Hereafter. (And such are they who are rightlyguided) to remember that we are Allah's and unto Him we shall return.
2|158|Allah then mentions the believers' dislike of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah in front of the idols whichwere placed there, saying: (Lo! Al-Safa and al-Marwah) going around al-Safa and al-Marwah (are among therites of Allah) among the rites of pilgrimage that Allah, Exalted is He, has commanded. (It is therefore nosin) one commits no transgression (for him who is on pilgrimage to the House or visiteth it, to go aroundthem (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his own accord) and whoever performs extraworks other than this obligation of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah, (Lo! Allah is Responsive) acceptssuch works, (Aware) of your intentions; it is also said that this means: Allah accepts the smallest of yourworks and His reward is abundant.
2|159|(Those who hide the proofs) the commands, prohibitions and the signs mentioned in the Torah (and theguidance) i.e. the description given there of Muhammad (pbuh) and his feature (which We revealed)exposited, (after We had made it clear) to the Children of Israel (in the Scripture) in the Torah: (such areaccursed of Allah) Allah will torment them in the grave (and are accursed of those who have the power tocurse) all created beings, save human beings and jinn, will curse them upon hearing their screams from thegrave.
2|160|(Except such of them as repent) from Judaism (and amend) worship Allah alone without ascribing to Himany partners (and make manifest) the traits and description of Muhammad. (These it is towards whom Irelent) overlook their past transgressions. (I am the Relenting) towards those who repent, (the Merciful)towards him who dies in a state of repentance.
2|161|(Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers) in Allah and His Messenger; (on them is thecurse of Allah) the torment of Allah (and of the angels) the curse of the angels (and of men combined) thecurses directed by believers towards each other will end up as curses on these unbelievers.
2|162|(They ever dwell therein) i.e. in this curse. (The doom will not be lightened for them) it will not be lifted orreduced, (neither will they be reprieved) their torment will not be deferred.
2|163|Allah then declares His Oneness because the unbelievers denied this divine Oneness, saying: (Your God isone God) without son or partner; (there is no God save Him, the Beneficent) the Tender, (the Merciful) theCompassionate.
2|164|Then He mentioned the sign of His divine Oneness, saying: (Lo! In the creation of the heavens and theearth) i.e. in their making; or as it is said: in the making of what is in them, (and the difference of night andday) in the alternation of night and day, and in the increase and decrease of their duration, (and the shipswhich run upon the sea with that which is of use to men) in their livelihoods, (and the water) rain (whichAllah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving) through rain (the earth after its death) after suffering bydrought and being dried up, (and dispersing) creating (all kinds of beasts) male and female (therein, and theordinance of the winds) in changing the direction of the wind towards the right and towards the left, comingsometimes from the East and sometimes from the West, sometimes carrying torment and sometimes mercy:(and the clouds obedient) subservient (between heaven and earth) He says: in all these (are signs)indications of the Lord's divine Oneness (for people who have sense) who believe that they are from Allah.
2|165|Allah mentions after this the unbelievers' love for their objects of worship in this world, and how they disowneach other in the Hereafter, saying: (Yet of mankind) i.e. the unbelievers (are some who take untothemselves) who worship (rivals to Allah) idols, (loving them with a love like (that which is the due) of Allah)like the love that sincere believers have for Allah (-Those who believe are stauncher) more lasting (in theirlove for Allah) than are the unbelievers vis-�-vis their idols; it is also said that this verse was revealed aboutthe hypocrites who buried their gold and silver or hid it in caves; and it is also said that this means: theytook their leaders as gods (-that those who do evil had but known) if only the idolaters knew, (when theybehold the doom) on the Day of Judgement, (that power) and might and invincibility (belongeth wholly toAllah, and that Allah is severe in punishment!) in the Hereafter-if they knew this, they would certainly havebelieved in this world.
2|166|(When those who were followed) the leaders (disown those who followed (them)) the lowly among people,(and they behold) both the leaders and the lowly (the doom) in the Hereafter, (and all their aims) thepledges and congeniality that were between them in this world (collapse with them).
2|167|(And those who were but followers) i.e. the lowly (will say: If a return) to this world (were possible for us,we would disown them) disown the leaders in this world (even as they have disowned us) in the Hereafter.(Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish) as regrets (for them) in the Hereafter, (and they)the leaders and those who followed them (will not emerge from the Fire).
2|168|Allah then mentions the lawfulness of cultivating land and raising cattle, saying: (O mankind) O people ofMecca! (Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome) that is not prohibited by Allah (in the earth) of what iscultivated in lands and of cattle, (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) the embellishments andwhisperings of the devil concerning the unlawfulness of the cultivation of land and of raising cattle. (Lo! Heis an open enemy for you) whose enmity towards you is quite manifest.
2|169|(He) the devil (enjoineth upon you only the evil) evil works (and the foul) transgressions, (and that yeshould tell) lies (concerning Allah that which ye know not).
2|170|(And when it is said unto them) to the Arab idolaters: (Follow that which Allah hath revealed) follow thelawfulness exposited by Allah concerning what is cultivated and the cattle raised, (they say: We follow thatwherein we found our fathers) regarding their unlawfulness. (What! Even though their fathers were whollyunintelligent) with regard to Religion (and had no guidance) to the practice of any prophet, so how couldyou follow them? It is also said that this means: if their fathers did not understand about things in this worldand did not follow the practice of any prophet, then how could you follow them? It is also said that thismeans: even though their fathers did not understand anything of Religion and were not guided to thepractice of any prophet, how could they follow them?
2|171|Allah then gave a similitude regarding the unbelievers vis-�-vis Muhammad (pbuh) saying: (The likeness ofthose who disbelieve) vis-�-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that whichheareth nothing) just like camels and sheep with their shepherd: his speech is unintelligible to them whenhe says to them, for example, eat or drink (except a shout and a cry. Deaf) concerning the Truth, (dumb)regarding the Truth, (blind) to guidance; i.e. they pretend to be deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to theTruth and guidance, (therefore they have no sense) they do not understand Allah's command and the call ofthe Prophet (pbuh) just as camels and cattle do not comprehend the words of their shepherd.
2|172|Then Allah mentions the lawfulness of eating what is cultivated on the land and the meat of cattle, saying:(O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you) of the lawful things We havegiven you, (and render thanks to Allah) for it (if it is (indeed) He whom ye worship) it is also said that thismeans: if you really intend to worship Allah by declaring these to be unlawful, then do not declare themunlawful, for to worship Allah entails that you declare them to be lawful.
2|173|Then Allah exposited what He made unlawful for them, saying: (He hath forbidden you only carrion) whichHe has commanded to immolate, (and blood) and shed blood, (and swineflesh, and that which hath beenimmolated to any other than Allah) that which is offered as sacrifice purposefully in any other thing than theName of Allah, i.e. to idols. (But he who is driven by necessity) compelled to eat carrion (neither craving)neither rebelling nor declaring it lawful (nor transgressing) nor committing highway robbery nor purposefullyeating it without being driven by necessity, (it is no sin for him) then such a person, who is compelled to eatit without having his fill and without taking anything with him, has not transgressed. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving)that he ate more than he needs to preserve himself, (Merciful) when He gave him legal dispensation to eatcarrion.
2|174|(Lo! Those who hide anything of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed) what Allah has exposited in theTorah regarding the description and traits of Muhammad, (and purchase) by concealing this (a small gaintherewith) a small profit, this was revealed about Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy IbnAkhtab (they eat into their bellies) they put into their bellies (nothing else than fire) except the unlawful; andit is also said that this means: they eat nothing except that which will turn into fire in their bellies on the Dayof Judgement. (And Allah will not speak to them) nicely (on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make thempure) He will not absolve them of their transgressions; it is also said that this means: He will not commendthem in any good way. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a painful torment that will extend to their hearts.
2|175|(Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance) they purchased disbelief for the price of faith,(and torment at the price of pardon) Judaism for the price of Islam; it is also said that this means: theychose that which leads to the Fire instead of that which leads to Paradise. (How constant are they in theirstrife to reach the Fire) how bold are they to delve into the Fire? It is also said that this means: what madethem so bold as to enter the Fire? And it is also said: how they indulging indeed in the works of the peopleof the Fire.
2|176|(That is) the torment (because Allah hath revealed the Scripture) He sent down Gabriel with the Qur'an andthe Torah (with the Truth) with an exposition of the Truth and falsehood, but they disbelieved. (Lo! Thosewho find disagreement in the Scripture) those who contravene that which is in the Book regarding thedescription and traits of Muhammad (pbuh) and further conceal the latter (are in open schism) are too muchin disagreement with guidance.
2|177|(It is not righteousness) it is not all of righteousness; it is also said that (It is not righteousness) means: it isnot faith (that ye merely turn your faces) in prayer (to the East) towards Mecca (and the West) towardsJerusalem; (but righteous is) but faith amounts to agreeing with (he who believeth in Allah) and it is alsosaid: the faithful is he who believes in Allah (and the Last Day) in resurrection after death (and the angels)all the angels (and the Scripture) all the revealed Books (and the prophets) and all the prophets; Allah thenmentions the obligated duties after mentioning faith, saying: (and giveth his wealth for love of Him)righteousness after declaring one's faith is that one gives of one's wealth, despite the fact that one loves anddesires it and has only a little of it, (to kinsfolk) relatives (and to orphans) orphans of the believers (and theneedy) who shy away from asking for assistance (and the wayfarer) the passer-by, the guest (and to thosewho ask) you to give them from your wealth, (and to set slaves free) those who made a contract to pay fortheir freedom and those who fight in the way of Allah.

Thisverse was revealed regarding two Arab clans but is abrogated by the verse: (... a life for a life) [5:45].

(Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives the deceased if he transgresses or makes a mistake, (Merciful) inrelation to the deed of the testator; it is also said that this means: He forgives the testator, and He is alsomerciful because He gave dispensation to reduce bequests to a third and thus commanded that one adhereto fairness.

But this is abrogated by Allah'ssaying: (And whoever of you is present, let him fast the month). It is also said that this means: those whocan afford a ransom and are not able to fast, old men and women who are unable to fast, they should feeda needy person, for every missed day of fast in Ramadan, half a measure of wheat.

(Therefore keep your duty unto Me) fear Me in the Sacred Precinct, (O men ofunderstanding). This verse was revealed about some people from the Yemen who used to perform thepilgrimage without taking any provisions with them. As a consequence, they used to wrongfully obtainprovisions from the settlements they found on their way and hence Allah now prohibited them from doingso.
2|198|(It is no sin) there is no constraint (for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading)) by engagingin trade in the Sacred Precinct. This was revealed about a group of people who were against buying andselling in the Sacred Precinct, and so legal dispensation was given to allow it. (But, when you press on in themultitude from 'Arafat) when you return from 'Arafat to the Sacred monument, (remember Allah) with yourheart and tongue (by the Sacred monument.

(Allah is swift in reckoning) Allah says: when He takes people totask, His reckoning is swift; it is also said that this means: swift in His protection. It is said that this means:His punishment is severe towards those who show off in their devotional works.

(Be careful of your duty to Allah) He says: fear Allah in taking what is hunteduntil the third day, (and know that unto Him ye will be gathered) after you die
2|204|(And of mankind there is he whose conversation on the life of this world pleaseth thee (Muhammad)) hisspeech, words and outward appearance pleases you, (and he calleth Allah to witness as to that which is inhis heart) he swears by Allah that he loves and follows you; (yet he is the most rigid of opponents) yet heargues about falsehood and is a staunch opponent.
2|205|(And when he turneth away (from thee)) when he is angry (his effort in the land is to make mischieftherein) by committing transgressions (and to destroy the crops) and stacks of grain by burning them (andthe cattle) by killing them; (and Allah loveth not mischief) or those who commit it.
2|206|(And when it is said unto him: Be careful of your duty to Allah) regarding what you are doing, (pride takethhim to sin) he takes offence because of his pride. (Hell will settle his account) his destination will be hell, (anevil resting place). This verse was revealed about al-Akhnas Ibn Shurayq who was both eloquent and goodlooking and the Prophet (pbuh) used to like his speech. This person used to say to him that he loved himand that he was entirely with him in secret and in the open, and used to give his oath to this effect. But hewas a hypocrite and it is alleged that he burned someone's crops and killed a donkey belonging to others.
2|207|(And of mankind is he who would sell himself) with his wealth, (seeking the pleasure of Allah) in pursuit ofAllah's pleasure. This was revealed about Suhayb Ibn Sinan and his companions. He ransomed himself fromthe Meccans with his money; (and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen) those who were killed inMecca. This was revealed about the parents of 'Ammar Ibn Yasir (Yasir and Sumayyah) and others whowere killed by the Meccan idolaters.
2|208|(O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission) come all of you to the prescriptions of the Religion ofMuhammad (pbuh); (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) follow not the embellishments of the devilregarding the unlawfulness of the Sabbath, the meat of camels and other things. (Lo! He is an open enemyfor you) whose enmity is quite manifest.
2|209|(And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you) after the exposition which is in yourScripture, (then know that Allah is Mighty) in His vengeance towards anyone who does not follow HisMessenger, (Wise) in abrogating the laws of bygone nations. This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Salamand his companions because they disliked the Sabbath and the meat of camels amongst other things.
2|210|(Wait they) the people of Mecca (for nothing else than that Allah should come unto them) on the Day ofJudgement, but this coming is without any modality (bila-kayfa) (in the shadows of the clouds with theangels? Then the case would be already judged) the people of Paradise would already be in Paradise andthe people of hell in hell. (All cases go back to Allah) the consequences of all things go back to Allah in theHereafter.
2|211|(Ask the children of Israel) tell the children of Jacob (how many a clear revelation We gave them!) how maytimes We addressed them with commands and prohibitions, and honoured them with Religion in the time ofMoses, but they exchanged all that with disbelief. (He who altereth the grace of Allah) whoever exchangesthe Religion and Scripture of Allah with disbelief (after it hath come unto him) after what Muhammad hascome with ((for him), lo! Allah is severe in punishment) for whoever disbelieves in Him.
2|212|(Beautified is the life of the world) what is in this world of comfortable living (for those who disbelieve) AbuJahl and his entourage; (they make a jest of believers) Salman [al-Farisi], Bilal [Ibn Rabah], Suhayb [al-Rumi] and their fellow believers because of their abject poverty. (But those who ward off) disbelief andascribing partners to Allah: i.e. Salman and his fellow believers (will be above them) in this world by havinga strong argument against them and also by having status and standing (on the Day of Resurrection. Allahgiveth) abundant wealth (without stint) without faltering or affectation; it is also said that He gives towhoever He wills in Paradise without stint (to whom He will).
2|213|(Mankind were) in the times of Noah and Abraham (one community) of disbelievers; as it is said that thismeans: there were in the time of Abraham followers of the true Religion (Muslims), (and Allah sentProphets) from the children of Noah and Abraham (as bearers of good tidings) of Paradise for whoeverbelieves in Allah (and as warners) from hell for whoever does not believe in Allah, (and revealed therewiththe Scripture) He sent down Gabriel to them with the Scripture, (with the Truth) expositing what is true andwhat is false (that it might judge) so that each prophet would judge by his Scripture (between mankindconcerning that wherein they differed) in Religion; it is also said that this means: so that the Scripture isused as a final authority; and it is also said that this means: so that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) rulesthem by the Scripture. (And only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it)concerning the Religion and Muhammad (pbuh) (after clear proofs had come unto them) clear proofs fromtheir own Scripture, (through hatred one of another) out of resentful envy from their part and this is whythey disbelieved in it. (And Allah by His will guided those who believe) by means of the prophets (unto theTruth of that concerning which they differed) in Religion. It is also said that this means: Allah protected thebelievers by means of the prophets from that which they differed over in matters of Religion, and directedthem from falsehood to the Truth. (Allah guideth whom He will) whomever deserves it; and it is also saidthat this means: Allah holds firm whomever He wills by His grace and will (unto a straight path) unto anestablished religion that He is pleased with.
2|214|(Or think ye) O group of believers!-referring here to 'Uthman [Ibn 'Affan] and his fellow believers-(that yewill enter Paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of (that which came to) those whopassed away before you?) i.e. without being tried as were the believers who came before you. (Affliction)fear, calamities, hardships (and adversity) sickness, pain and hunger (befell them) visited them, (they wereshaken as with an earthquake) in hardship, (till the Messenger (of Allah)) until their Messenger (and thosewho believed along with him) those who believed in him (said: When cometh Allah's help) over the enemy?Allah said to that Prophet: (Now surely Allah's help) over your enemy by means of your safety (is near).
2|215|(They ask thee (O Muhammad)) and this was before the verse of inheritance was revealed (what they shallspend) to whom they should give in charity. (Say: That which ye spend for good) of your wealth ((must go)to parents and near kindred) later, giving charity to parents was abrogated by the verse on inheritance (andorphans) He says: give in charity to the orphans (and the needy) the needy among people (and thewayfarer) the guest who drops by. (And whatsoever good ye do) whatever wealth you spend on these, (lo!Allah is Aware of it) Allah knows it as He knows your intention and He will reward you for it.
2|216|(Warfare is ordained for you) in times of a general call to arms with the Prophet (pbuh) (though it is hatefulunto you) hard on you; (but it may happen that ye hate a thing) fighting in the way of Allah (which is goodfor you) in that you obtain martyrdom and spoils, (and it may happen that ye love a thing) abstaining fromfighting in the way of Allah (which is bad for you) in that you will not obtain martyrdom or spoils. (And Allahknoweth) that fighting in His way is better for you, (ye know not) that abstention from fighting in His way isbad for you. This was revealed about Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas, al-Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad and their associates. Itwas then revealed regarding 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his companions who killed 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami andtheir asking about warfare during the sacred month-in reference here to Rajab: i.e. the last afternoon ofJumada II, before seeing the moon of Rajab-for the unbelievers had censored them from doing so.
2|217|And so Allah said: (They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month) aboutwaging war in the month of Rajab. (Say: Warfare therein) in the month of Rajab (is a great (transgression))deserving a great punishment, (but to turn (men) from the way of Allah) but preventing people from theReligion of Allah and His obedience, (and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship) andturning people away from the Inviolable Place of Worship, (and to expel its people from it, is a greater sin)deserving a greater punishment (with Allah) than the killing of 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami; (for persecution)associating partners with Allah (is worse than slaughter) the slaughter of 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami. (And they),the people of Mecca, (will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from yourreligion) the religion of Islam, (if they can) if they are able to do so. (And whoso becometh a renegade)whoever renounces Islam (and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen) their works arethwarted and their good deeds rejected (both in the world and the Hereafter) and they will not be rewardedin the Hereafter. (And such are rightful owners of the Fire) the people of hell: (they will abide thereinforever) they will neither die nor leave it.
2|218|The following was also revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his companions: (Lo! Those who believe) inAllah and His Messenger, (and those who emigrate) from Mecca to Medina (and strive in the way of Allah)by killing the unbeliever 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami, (these have hope in Allah's mercy) they shall obtain Allah'sGarden. (And Allah is Forgiving) of what they have done, (Merciful) towards them, since He did not punishthem.
2|219|(They question thee about strong drink and games of chance). This was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who prayed: "O Allah! Show us Your judgement regarding alcoholic drinks!" So Allah said toMuhammad (pbuh): (Say) O Muhammad! (in both is great sin) this is after they were declared unlawful,(and (some) utility for men) by means of their trading, i.e. before they were unlawful; (but the sin of them)after their being declared unlawful (is greater than their usefulness) before they were made unlawful; andthen both were prohibited. (And they ask thee what they ought to spend). This was revealed about 'Amr Ibnal-Jamuh who asked the Prophet (pbuh): "What should we spend from our wealth". Allah told His Prophet:they ask you about what they should spend from their wealth. (Say: That which is superfluous) that which isin surplus to your sustenance requirements and of food for your dependents. But this was abrogated bythose verses on the poor-due. (Thus Allah maketh plain to you (the) revelations) the commands andprohibitions and the insignificance of this world, (that ye may reflect) that it is evanescent.
2|220|(Upon the world and the Hereafter) that it is lasting. (And they question thee concerning orphans). This wasrevealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah who asked the Prophet (pbuh) about whether it was lawful to sharefood, drink and shelter with orphans. Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about sharing food, drink andshelter with orphans, (Say) O Muhammad: (To improve their lot) and their wealth (is best) rather than notsharing with them. (And if you mingle your affairs with theirs) as regards food, drink and shelter, (then (theyare) your brothers) in Religion and you should therefore safeguard their shares. (And Allah knoweth himwho spoileth) the wealth of orphans (from him who improveth) their wealth. (Had Allah willed He could haveoverburdened you) He could have forbidden such sharing. (Indeed Allah is Mighty) and takes revengeagainst whoever spoils the wealth of orphans, (Wise) ruling that the wealth of orphans should be improved.
2|221|(Wed not idolatresses). This was revealed about Marthad Ibn Abi Marthad Al-Ghanawi who wanted to marryan idolatress woman by the name of 'Inaq. Allah prohibited such marriage, saying: do not marry idolatresseswomen (till they believe) in Allah; (for lo! A believing bondwoman) marrying a believing slave woman (isbetter than an idolatress) who is a free woman (though she pleases you) though you may like hercomeliness and beauty; (and give not your daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe) in Allah, (forlo! A believing slave) Allah says: giving your daughters in marriage to a believing slave (is better than anidolater) is better than your daughter marrying an idolater who is free (though he pleases you) though hisbody and strength may please you. (These invite unto the Fire) they invite to disbelief and to works thatlead to hell, (and Allah inviteth unto the Garden) by means of His divine Oneness, (and unto forgiveness)through repentance (by His grace) by His leave, (and He expoundeth thus His revelations) His commandsand prohibitions regarding marriage (to mankind that they may remember) so that they may takeadmonition and refrain from unlawful marriage.
2|222|(They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation) this was revealed about Abu'l-Dahdah whoasked the Prophet (pbuh) about it. Allah said to His Prophet: they ask you about sexual intercourse duringmenstruation, (Say) O Muhammad: (it is harmful) it is filth and unlawful, (so keep away from women at suchtime) so refrain from having sexual intercourse during menstruation (and go not unto them) do not have sexwith them (till they are cleansed) of menstruation. (And when they have purified themselves) and have hada major ritual ablution (ghusl), (then go in unto them) you may have sex with them (as Allah hath enjoinedupon you) as you were dispensed to do before, i.e. penetration ought to be in the pudendum. (Truly Allahloveth those who turn unto Him) those who repent of transgression (and loveth those who have a care forcleanness) those who have a care for turning away from transgression and filth.
2|223|(Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate)) He says: the vulvas of your wives are plantations for youroffspring (so go to your tilth) your plantations (as ye will) as you please, from behind or front as long as thepenetration is in the pudendum, (and send (good deeds) before you for your souls) righteous children, (andfear Allah) regarding penetrating your wives in their anus or having sex with them during menstruation, (andknow that ye will (one day) meet Him) that you will see Him after you die and He will reward you accordingto your deeds. (Give glad tidings to believers (O Muhammad)) Allah says: give glad tidings, O Muhammad,to the believers, who ward off penetrating their wives in their anus and further abstain from having sex withthem when they are menstruating, that Paradise will be theirs.
2|224|(And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance) a reason by means of which you make your oaths. Thiswas revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah who swore not to show kindness to his sister and her husbandand not to speak with them or make up between them. But Allah warned him against doing so, saying: donot make Allah a reason by means of which you make oaths, (to your being righteous) that you should nothonour your oath (and observing your duty unto Him) and ward off severing ties of kinship (and makingpeace) and not make peace (among mankind). He says: return to that which is better for you and makeamend for your oaths; it is also said that this means: avoid making oaths by Allah about not showingkindness to anyone and your not making peace between people. (For Allah is Hearer) of your oath to stopshowing kindness to people, (Knower) of your intentions and the amends that will absolve you from youroaths.
2|225|(Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths) by imposing amends forunintentional oaths such as saying: "No, by Allah" or "Yes indeed, by Allah" upon buying and selling andupon other instances of idle talk. (But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered)what is hidden in your hearts. (And Allah is Forgiving) of your unintentional oaths, (Clement) in that He doesnot hasten punishment upon you; it is also said: idle talk is an oath for committing transgression. If onerefrains from it and makes amends, then Allah does not take one to task for it; but if one does not refrainfrom so doing, then Allah will take one to task for it.
2|226|(Those who forswear their wives) those who abstain from having sex with their wives because of an oaththey have made, should not touch them for a period of four months (may wait up to four months) theyshould wait four months; (then, if they change their mind) if they have sex with them before the elapse offour months, (lo! Allah is Forgiving) that they have not honoured their oath, provided they repent, (Merciful)in that He made the amends due on them clear.
2|227|(And if they decide upon divorce) have actually divorced and honoured their oaths ((let them rememberthat) Allah is Hearer) of one's oath, (Knower) of the fact that one's wife has been divorced through onesingle pronouncement of divorce after a period of fourth months and through honouring the oath that wasmade. This verse was revealed about a man who swore not to have sex with his wife for four months orlonger. If this man had honoured his oath, his wife would have been considered divorced from him, onesingle act of divorce; if, on the other hand, he had sex with her before the elapse of this period, he shouldmake amends for breaking his oath.
2|228|(Women who are divorced) through one or two pronouncements of divorce (shall wait) shall wait a certaintime called the waiting period, (keeping themselves apart, three (monthly) courses) for three menstruationperiods. (And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal) their pregnancy (that which Allah hathcreated in their wombs) of offspring (if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbandswould do better to take them back) to take them back as their wives (in that case) during the waiting periodor if they are pregnant (if they desire reconciliation.) This is because in the early period of Islam, when aman divorced his wife via one or two pronouncements of divorce, he had a better right to take her backafter the lapse of the waiting period, before her marrying again. Later, the right to take one's wife back wasabrogated by the saying of Allah: (Divorce must be pronounced twice). Similarly, a man had a better right totake his wife back if she were pregnant, even if he had pronounced her divorce a thousand times. This washowever abrogated by Allah's saying: (divorce them for their (legal) period) [65:1]. (And they (women) haverights) and inviolability with their husbands (similar to those) of their husbands (over them in kindness) inkind companionship and intercourse, (and men are a degree above them) in relation to the reasoningfaculty, inheritance, blood money, as witnesses in court and also that which they owe them in terms ofexpenditure and service. (Allah is Mighty) in that He is vengeful vis-�-vis whoever leaves that which isbetween a husband and wife of rights and inviolability, (Wise) regarding that which He has ruled betweenthem.
2|229|(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife ispronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she ispronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation(in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time withsuch kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of thatwhich ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wifeboth know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposedby) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if youknow (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating therelationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially thehusband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out ofthe generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilahwas the daughter of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed herdivorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) therulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not stepbeyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) steps beyond them: (suchare wrong-doers) harmful to themselves.
2|230|Allah then went back to His saying: (Divorce must be pronounced twice) saying: (And if he hath divorcedher) i.e. the third time, (then she is not lawful unto him thereafter) after the third divorce (until she hathwedded another husband) and the marriage must be consummated. (Then if he (the other husband) divorceher) this was revealed about 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn al-Zubayr, (it is no sin for both of them) the first husbandand the woman (that they come together again) with a new dowry and marriage contract (if they consider)if they know (that they are able to observe the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationshipbetween husband and wife. (These are the limits of Allah) these are Allah's rulings and obligations. (Hemanifesteth them for people who have knowledge) they are from Allah and believe them to be so.
2|231|(When ye have divorced women) one pronouncement of divorce, (and they have reached their term) theirwaiting period before they have a major ritual ablution after the third menstruation, (then retain them) takethem back as your wives (in kindness) with kind companionship and intercourse (or release them) let themhave their major ritual ablution and end the waiting period (in kindness) that will restore their rights. (Retainthem not to their hurt) in a way that causes their hurt (so that ye transgress (the limits)) that you transgressagainst them by prolonging their waiting period for them. (He who doeth that) he who so hurts his wife(hath wronged his own soul) has caused harm to himself. (Make not the revelations of Allah) His commandsand prohibitions (a laughing stock (by your behaviour)) by not acting upon them, (but remember Allah'sgrace upon you) preserve Allah's blessing on you Who gave you Islam (and that which He hath revealedunto you of the Scripture) in the Scripture of commands and prohibitions (and of wisdom) the lawful and theunlawful, (whereby He doth exhort you) prohibits you from hurting them. (Observe your duty to Allah) fearAllah if you hurt them (and know that Allah is Aware of all things) harming others as well as other things.
2|232|(And when ye have divorced women) one or two pronouncements of divorce (and they have reached theirterm) have completed their waiting period and want to return to their first husbands with a new dowry andmarriage contract, (place not difficulties in the way of) do not prevent them (their marrying their husbands ifit is agreed between them in kindness) a new dowry and marriage contract. (This) what is mentioned above(is an admonition) a command (for him among you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day. This) what ismentioned above (is more virtuous) better (for you, and cleaner) for your hearts and theirs from misgivingsand enmity. (Allah knoweth) the love of the wife for her husband: (while ye know not) this. This verse wasrevealed about Ma'qil Ibn Yasar al-Muzani who prevented his sister Jamilah from returning to her firsthusband 'Abdullah Ibn 'Asim with a new dowry and marriage contract. Allah forbade him from doing so.
2|233|(Mothers) who are divorced (shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those who wish tocomplete the suckling) of the child. (The duty of feeding) of suckling the child (and clothing nursing mothersin a seemly manner) without excess or stinginess (is upon the father of the child. No soul should becharged) for providing sustenance for suckling (beyond its capacity) except in proportion of what Allah hasgiven it of wealth. (A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child) by taking her child from herafter having accepted what was given to someone else for suckling her child, (nor should he whom the childis born) i.e. the father ((be made to suffer) because of his child) by handing him the child after the latterbecame familiar with his mother and would not take any other breast. (And on the (father's) heir) the heir ofthe father and it is also said the heir of the child (is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on thefather)) in terms of providing sustenance and avoiding causing harm, in case this person is not the father.(If they) the mother and father (desire to wean the child by mutual consent) of the father and mother (and(after) consultation) between them, (it is no sin for them) i.e. the father and mother, if they do not sucklethe child two full years; (and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse) by other than the mother and thelatter wants to remarry, (it is no sin for you) for both the mother and father, (provided that ye pay what isdue from you) provided that you spend what you have given (in kindness) in consent and without anydisagreement. (And observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding harming and disagreement, (and knowthat Allah is Seer of what ye do).
2|234|(Such of you as die) among your men (and leave behind them wives, they (the wives) shall wait) a waitingperiod, (keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term (prescribed forthem)) when they complete their waiting period (then there is no sin for you) for the relatives of thedeceased (in aught that they may do with themselves) in terms of making themselves attractive (in decency)for the purpose of remarrying. (And Allah is Informed of what ye do) whether it is good or evil.
2|235|(There is no sin on you) there is no harm in talking (in that which ye proclaim or hide in your mindconcerning your troth with women) concerning your offer to the woman whose husband is dead, before thewaiting period ends, that you desire to marry her after the waiting period, such as saying to her: "If Allahunites us lawfully, I would like that". (Allah knoweth that you will remember them) remember marryingthem. (But plight not your troth with them) to have sexual intercourse with them (except by uttering arecognised form of words) properly and unequivocally by saying for example: "If Allah unites us lawfully, Iwould like that", and no more. (And do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run)until the waiting period comes to an end. (And know that Allah knoweth what is in your minds) in yourhearts whether you are going to honour your pledge or not, (so beware of Him) beware of contraveningHim; (and know that Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent of transgressing against Him, (Clement) sinceHe does not hasten His punishment upon those who transgress against Him.
2|236|(There is no sin on you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them) while you have not hadsex with them, (nor appointed unto them a portion) or have not specified a dowry for them. (Provide forthem) as divorce requires, (the rich according to his means, and the strained according to his means, a fairprovision) this is in surplus of the price given to the prostitute for her services (mahr al-baghiy), the leastamount of it consists of a chemise, a head covering and a wrap. ((This is) a bounden duty for those who dogood) it is an obligation upon those who believe in the divine Oneness of Allah because it is a substitute forthe dowry.
2|237|Then Allah exposited on the legal ruling of she whose dowry had been specified, saying: (And if ye divorcethem before ye have touched them) before you have had sexual intercourse with them (and ye haveappointed unto them a portion) you have specified a dowry for them, (then (pay the) half of that which yeappointed) half of the dowry you specified, (unless they (the women) agree to forgo it) unless the womanforgoes her right and leaves it to the husband, (or he agreeth to forgo it in whose is the marriage tie), or thehusband forgoes his right and gives the woman her full dowry. (To forgo) your rights (is nearer to piety) isnearer to piety for the God-fearing. Allah says here to the husband and wife: it is more conducive to God-fearing if you forgo your right to the other; (And forget not kindness among yourselves) Allah says to both:continue to be kind and generous to each other. (Indeed Allah is Seer of what ye do) of acts of kindness andgenerosity.
2|238|Allah then prompted the believers to observe the five daily prayers, saying: (Be guardians of your prayers)the five daily prayers including the ritual ablution that precede them, their bowings, prostrations, andeverything prescribed in them during their appointed times, (and of the midmost prayer) the 'Asr prayerspecifically, (and stand up with devotion to Allah) pray to Allah, by performing the bowings and prostrationsthis prayer includes; it is also said that this means: pray to Him by being obedient to Him in the prayer andnot disobedient through engagement in mundane talk.
2|239|(And if ye go in fear) of the enemy's sword, (then (pray) standing or on horseback) in whatever direction.(And when ye are again in safety) from the enemy, (remember Allah) pray to Allah performing the bowingsand prostrations, (as He hath taught you) in the Qur'an: the traveller prays two units of prayer while theresident prays four units (that which ye knew not) before the revelation of the Qur'an.
2|240|((In the case of) those who are about to die and leave behind them wives, they should bequeath unto theirwives a provision) regarding their wealth (for the year) sustenance and habitation for a year (withoutturning them out) of the houses of their husbands, (but if they go out) of their own accord, or if they marrybefore the lapse of a year (there is no sin on you) on the inheritors of the deceased to stop providingsustenance and habitation after she leaves the house of her husband or remarries (in that which they do ofthemselves) nor is there any blame on them in what the wives do to themselves (within their rights) lookingforward to remarriage, making themselves beautiful for this purpose. This, i.e. the sustenance due on thedeceased towards any wife he leaves behind, was however abrogated by her inheritance. (Allah is Mighty)for He is vengeful towards any that leaves what He has commanded, (Wise) in that He abrogatedapportioning a year of sustenance and habitation to the wife whose husband is deceased and substituted itwith what is due to her of inheritance: a quarter or eighth of the deceased's wealth.
2|241|(For divorced women a provision in kindness) with generosity and kindness: (a duty for those who ward off(evil)). It is an obligation because it is in surplus to the dowry, and it is done out of generosity.
2|242|(Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations) His commands and prohibitions (so that ye mayunderstand) what you have been commanded to do.
2|243|Then Allah mentioned the story of the fighters among the Children of Israel, saying: (Bethink thee (OMuhammad)) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, (of those of old, who went forth from theirhabitations) to fight their enemies (in their thousands) eight thousand in total, but they proved too cowardlyto fight, (fearing death) out of fear of being killed, (and Allah said unto them: Die) Allah killed them on thespot, (and then He brought them back to life) after eight days. (Lo! Allah is the Lord of Kindness tomankind) to these people for He brought them back to life, (but most of mankind give not thanks) for life.
2|244|Allah then said to them after He brought them back to life: (And fight in the way of Allah) in obedience ofAllah against your enemies, (and know that Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your intentionsand the punishment that is going to visit you if you disobey what you have been commanded to do.
2|245|Allah then prompted the believer to give in charity, saying: (Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan)in charity sincerely wanting nothing but the sake of Allah, (so that He may give it increase manifold forhim?) every act is rewarded a thousand times (Allah straiteneth) withholds wealth from people (andenlargeth) gives plenty to whomever He wills in this worldly life. (Unto Him ye will return) after you die andHe will requite each according to his works. This verse was revealed about a man from the Helpers (al-Ansar) named Abu'l-Dahdah or Abu'l-Dahdahah.
2|246|(Bethink thee) have you not been told (of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they saidunto a prophet whom they had) the prophet is Samuel (Shamwil): (Set up for us a king) show to us the kingof this army (and we will fight) under his command against our enemy (in Allah's way) in Allah's obedience.(He said: Would ye then) do you suppose then that you will (refrain from fighting if fighting) against yourenemy (were prescribed for you?) made obligatory upon you. (They said: why should we not fight in Allah'sway when we have been expelled from our dwellings) from our homes (and separated from our children)who were taken as slaves? (Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them) was made obligatory upon them,(they turned away) they refrained from fighting their enemy, (all save a few of them) 313 men. (And Allah isAware of evil-doers) who shy away from fighting their enemy.
2|247|(The Prophet) Samuel (said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up) identified (Saul to be king for you. Theysaid: How can) it be justified that (he have kingdom over us) for he is not of royal descent (when we aremore deserving of the kingdom than he is) for we are of royal descent, (since he hath not been given wealthenough) to spend on the army? (He) Samuel (said: Lo! Allah hath chosen him) to be king and sovereign(above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom) the knowledge of warfare (and stature) size andphysical strength. (Allah bestoweth His sovereignty on whom he will) in this life even if he is not of royaldescent. (Allah is All-Embracing) in His gift, (All-Knowing) about whom He gives to, because they said totheir prophet that it was he who chose Saul rather than his being appointed by Allah.
2|248|(And their Prophet) Samuel (said unto them: Lo! The token) the sign (of his kingdom) that it is from Allah (isthat there shall come unto you the Ark) that was taken from you (wherein is peace of reassurance) mercyand tranquillity; it is also said that this means: it includes the wind (the triumph) of his victory, of goldencolour in the form of a human face (from your Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of Moses) aremnant of Moses, i.e. his Scripture; as it is said: his tablets and staff (and the house of Aaron left behind)what Aaron had left behind, namely his cloak and turban, (the angels bearing it) the angels leading it. (Lo!Herein) in giving you back the Ark (shall be a token) a sign (for you) that he has been made king by Allah (if(in truth) ye are believers).
2|249|When they were given the Ark back, they accepted him as their king and went out with him to fight. (Andwhen Saul set out) went forth (with the army) through a wasteland and became very thirsty, they asked himto provide them with water, (he) i.e. Saul (said: Lo! Allah will try you by a river) Allah will test you by aflowing river. (Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof) from the river (he is not of me) he is not going to bewith me in the fight against my enemy and will not go further, (and whoever tasteth it not he is of me)against my enemy, but then he made an exception, (save him who taketh (thereof) in the hollow of hishand) and this was enough for them, their beasts and transportation. (But they drank thereof) when theyreached the river however they drank as much as they wanted to, (all save a few of them) 313 men who didnot drink except as they had been directed. (And after he had crossed) the river, (he) i.e. Saul (and thosewho believed with him, they said) to each other: (We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts.But those who knew) and were convinced (that they would meet Allah) in person after they died (exclaimed:How many a little company) of believers (hath overcome a mighty host) of unbelievers (by Allah's leave!) bythe help of Allah. (And Allah is with the steadfast) He assists the steadfast in war by giving them victory.
2|250|(And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they) those who believed (said: Our Lord!Bestow on us endurance) honour us by bestowing patience on us, (make our foothold sure) in war, (andgive us victory against the disbelieving folk) Goliath and his people.
2|251|(So they routed them by Allah's leave) by Allah's help (and David) the Prophet (slew Goliath) the unbeliever;(and Allah gave him the kingdom) Allah gave David sovereignty over the Children of Israel (and wisdom)understanding and prophethood, (and taught him of that which He willeth) i.e. how to make armour. (And ifAllah had not repelled some men by others) as He repelled through David the evil of Goliath from theChildren of Israel (the earth would have been corrupted). He says: Allah repelled from the believers, bymeans of the prophets, the evil of their enemies, and He repelled from those who refrained fromparticipating in the fight for Allah's sake, by means of those who fought in His sake, the evil of theirenemies. If it were not thus, the earth would have been corrupted. (But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to all theworlds) by this repelling.
2|252|(These are the revelations of Allah) i.e. the Qur'an which relates the events of past nations (which We reciteunto thee (Muhammad)) which We send Gabriel with to you (with Truth) to exposit the Truth and falsehood,(and lo! thou art of the number of (the) messengers) to all human beings and jinn;
2|253|(Of those messengers) whom We have named for you, (some of whom We have caused to excel others) bybestowing honour upon them, (and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake) this is Moses, (whilesome of them He exalted (above others) in degrees) this is Abraham whom Allah took as a friend, andEnoch whom Allah raised to an elevated place; (and We gave Jesus son of Mary clear proofs) commands,prohibitions and the working of marvels (and We supported him) strengthened and assisted him (with theholy Spirit) with Gabriel, the pure. (And if Allah had so willed it, those who followed after them) after Mosesand Jesus (would not have fought one with another) differed with one another (after clear proofs had comeunto them) the exposition in their Scriptures of the description and traits of Muhammad. (But they differed)in the matter of Religion, (some of them believing) in every Scripture and Messenger (and somedisbelieving) in the Scriptures and messengers. (And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have foughtone with another) they would not have differed with one another in the matter of the religion; (but Allahdoeth what He will) with His servants.
2|254|After this, Allah prompted them to give in charity, saying: (O ye who believe! spend of that wherewith Wehave provided you) give in charity from the wealth We have given you for the sake of Allah (ere a day) theDay of Judgement (come when there will be no trafficking) no ransom is accepted, (nor friendship, norintercession) for the disbelievers. (Disbelievers) in Allah (are the wrong-doers) who ascribe partners withAllah.
2|255|Allah then praises Himself, saying: (Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive) Who dies not, (the Eternal)the Self-existent Who has no beginning. (Neither slumber nor) deep (sleep overtaketh Him) such that He isdistracted from running and commanding it. (Unto Him belongeth whatever is in the heavens) of angels(and whatever is in the earth) of created beings. (Who is he that intercedeth with Him) from amongst thedwellers of the heavens and the earth on the Day of Judgement (save by His leave?) except by Hiscommand? (He knoweth that which is in front of them) in front of the angels regarding the matter of theHereafter and who is to intercede (and that which is behind them) of the life of this world, (while theyencompass nothing of His knowledge save that He will). Allah says: the angels know nothing of theHereafter or of the life of this world save that which Allah has taught them. (His throne includeth the heavenand the earth) He says that His Chair extends far beyond the heavens and the earth, (and He is never wearyof preserving them) it is not burdensome for Him to preserve the Throne and Chair without the angels. (Heis the Sublime) more sublime than anything, (the Tremendous) more tremendous than anything.
2|256|(There is no compulsion in religion) no one from among the people of the Book and the Magians should becoerced to believe in the divine Oneness of Allah after the Arabs' embrace of Islam. (The right direction ishenceforth distinct from error) faith from disbelief and Truth from falsehood. The following was revealedabout Mundhir Ibn Sawi al-Tamimi: (And he who rejecteth false deities) the command of the devil and theworship of idols (and believeth in Allah) and in what has come forth from Him (hath grasped a firmhandhold) has taken in trust "there is no God save Allah" (which will never break) will never cease, vanish orperish; it is also said that this means: for him who believes in it, the bliss of Paradise will never cease and hewill never be taken out of Paradise, nor will he perish by staying in the Fire. (Allah is Hearer) of this speech,(Knower) of its reward and bliss.
2|257|(Allah is the Protecting Friend of those who believe) He protects and gives victory to the believers, referringhere to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions. (He bringeth them out of darkness into light) He gavethem success and brought them out of disbelief into faith. (As for those who disbelieve) i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions, (their patrons are false deities) the devil. (They bring them out of light intodarkness) they invite them from faith to disbelief. (Such are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell.(They will abide therein forever) never to die or leave it.
2|258|(Bethink thee) have you not been informed (of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord)about the Religion of his Lord, (because Allah had given him the kingdom) he is Nimrod Ibn Canaan; (how,when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death) gives life upon the resurrection andcauses death by ending the life of this world, (he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said) giveme proof of what you say. So Nimrod brought two prisoners, killed one and spared the other and then said:this is my proof. When he saw this, Abraham said: (Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East) from thedirection of the East, (so do thou cause it to come up from the West) from the direction of the West. (Thuswas the disbeliever abashed) the one who disbelieved kept quiet and could not argue. (And Allah guidethnot) to the right argument (wrong-doing folk) the unbelievers, referring here to Nimrod.
2|259|(Or (bethink thee) the like of him who, passing by a township) He says: do you not know about 'Uzayr IbnShurahya who passed by the township of Dayr Hiraql (which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shallAllah give this township life after its death) How can Allah bring the people of this township back to life aftertheir death? (So Allah made him die) right on the spot (a hundred years, then brought him back to life) atthe end of the day. (He) Allah (said: How long hast thou tarried) O 'Uzayr? (He said: I have tarried for aday) and then looked at the sun still in the horizon and said (or part of a day. He) Allah (said: Nay, but thouhast tarried) you were dead (for a hundred years. Just look at thy food) figs and grapes (and drink) juice(which have not rotted! Look at thine ass!) look at the bones of your ass how white they look! (And, that Wemay make thee a token) a sign (to mankind) regarding the matter of bringing the dead to life, that they willbe resurrected in the same state they died in, because 'Uzayr died young and was brought back to life as ayoung person. It is said that Allah made him a lesson for people, for he died when he was 40 years old andwas brought back to life when his son was 120 years old, (look at the bones) the bones of your ass, (howWe adjust them and then cover them with flesh!) after this. He then said: We will make grow on it nervesand veins, flesh, skin and hair and put the spirit in it. (And when (the matter) became clear unto him) howAllah gathers the bones, (he said: I know) I had known (that Allah is Able to do all things) of life and death.
2|260|(And when Abraham) also (said: My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead) how you gather thebones of the dead again, (He said: Dost thou not believe?) are you not convinced? (Abraham said: Yea) Iam convinced, (but (I ask) in order that my heart may be at ease) in order that the heat of my heart abatesand so that I know that I am your friend and that my prayers are answered. ((His Lord) said: Take four ofthe birds) of different kinds: a cockerel, a raven, a duck and a peacock (and cause them to incline unto you)cut them into pieces, (then place a part of them on each hill) four different hills, (then call them) by theirnames, (they will come to thee) walking (in haste). (And know) O Abraham! (that Allah is Mighty) for He isvengeful against those who do not believe in bringing the dead back to life, (Wise) He gathers the bones ofthe dead and bring them back to life, just as He gathered these birds and brought them back to life.
2|261|Then Allah mentioned the spending of the believers in the way of Allah, saying: (The likeness of those whospend their wealth in Allah's way) He says: the likeness of the wealth of those who spend in His way (is asthe likeness of a grain which groweths seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains) likewise, Allah multiplieswhat the believers spend in His way from one to seven hundred fold. (Allah giveth increase manifold) insurplus of this (to whom He will) to whomever deserves it; it is also said: to whomever Allah accepts hisspending. (Allah is All-Embracing) by multiplying his reward manifold, (All-Knowing) of what the believersspend and of their intentions.
2|262|(Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah) this was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and 'Abdal-Rahman Ibn 'Awf, (and afterward make not reproach) to Allah (and injury) upon whom they spend it on(to follow that which they have spent) after their spending; (their reward is with their Lord) in Paradise, (andthere shall no fear come upon them) regarding any future torment, (neither shall they grieve) about whatthey have left behind.
2|263|(A kind word) a good word for your brother, in his absence, by praying for him and praising him in front ofother people, (with forgiveness) that overlooks any misdeed (is better) for him and you (than almsgivingfollowed by injury) than reminding him about your favour upon him which will hurt him. (Allah is Absolute)in His freedom from the need of such a person's charity, (Clement) for He does not hasten the punishmentof this person.
2|264|(O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving) the reward of your almsgiving (by reproach) to Allah,i.e. by being conceited (and injury) to the person receiving alms, (like him who spendeth his wealth only tobe seen of men) out of ostentation (and believeth not in Allah and the Last Day) does not believe inresurrection after death. (His likeness) the likeness of the person who reminds others about what he hasgiven them and the alms given by one who associates partners with Allah (is as the likeness of rock whereonis dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare) without any dust on it. (They have nocontrol of aught) to obtain a reward for anything in the Hereafter (of that which they have gained) thatwhich they have spent in the life of this world. Allah says here: the reward of the person who boasts aboutwhat he has spent on alms and of the person who hurts those he gives alms to, is like dust on a rock whenrain pours down on it and no dust remains. (Allah guideth not) rewards not (the disbelieving folk) and alsothose who show off their spending while still associating partners with Allah, just as He does not reward thealms of those who remind others about what they have spent on them.
2|265|(And the likeness of those who spend their wealth) the likeness of the wealth of those who spend it (insearch of Allah's pleasure) seeking Allah's pleasure, (and for the strengthening of their souls) truly, out ofconviction and certitude in their hearts that they will be rewarded, (is as the likeness of a garden on aheight) on an elevated plain. (The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if therainstorm smite it not, then the shower) this is like the spending of the believer, whether small or great,when it is done with sincerity and fearingness, Allah multiplies it as He multiplies the fruits of a garden.(Allah is Seer of what ye do) of what you spend.
2|266|(Would any of you like) wish (to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it)under its trees, houses and rooms, (with all kinds of fruit for him therein) in the garden; (and old age hathstricken him and he hath feeble offspring) who cannot fend for themselves; (and a fiery whirlwind) a strongcold or hot wind (striketh it) i.e. the garden (and it is (all) consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain Hisrevelations) His signs through commands and prohibitions (unto you, in order that you may give thought) sothat you may reflect on the similes of the Qur'an. This is also like the unbelievers in the Hereafter, they shallhave no power neither will they be able to come back to the life of this world just as a person advanced inage is without strength and cannot revert to his former vigour and youth.
2|267|(O ye who believe! spend of the good) of the lawful (things which ye have earned) which you have amassedof gold and silver, (and of that which we bring forth from the earth for you) of what is grown in the earth,i.e. grains and fruits, (and seek not the bad (with intent)) do not single out what is base among your wealth(to spend thereof (in charity) when ye would not take) accept (it for yourselves save with disdain) and afterforgoing some of your rights; likewise Allah does not accept what is base from you; (and know that Allah isAbsolute) and free from the need of your spending, (Owner of Praise) He is praised in His acts; as it is saidthat this means: He is grateful for small spending and rewards abundantly for spending in abundance. Thisverse was revealed about a man in Medina who was the owner of a type of dates called Hashaf.
2|268|(The devil promiseth you destitution) makes you scared of poverty upon spending in charity (and enjoinethon you lewdness) by not giving the poor-due. (But Allah promiseth you forgiveness) of your sins for givingthe poor-due (from Himself with bounty) with something in exchange as well as a reward in the Hereafter.(Allah is All-Embracing) in that He replaces what you spend and also forgives sins, (All-Knowing) of yourintentions and spending.
2|269|Then Allah mentioned His favour, saying: (He giveth wisdom unto whom He will) i.e. prophethood toMuhammad (pbuh); it is also said that wisdom here means the interpretation of the Qur'an; as it is said thatit refers to being in the right in speech, action and opinion, (and he unto him wisdom) being in the right inspeech, action and opinion (is given, he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember) takesadmonitions from the similes of the Qur'an or wisdom (except men of understanding) those who have mindsfrom among people.
2|270|(Whatever alms ye spend) for the sake of Allah (or vow ye vow) in obedience of Allah which you honour,(Lo! Allah knoweth it). Allah accepts it if it is solely for His Countenance as He also rewards for it. (Wrong-doers) those who ascribe partners to Allah (have no helpers) who can save them from Allah's torment.
2|271|Allah then mentions almsgiving that is done in the open and that which is done secretly because they askedabout it, saying: (If ye publish) if you show (your almsgiving) which is obligated upon you, (it is well, but ifye hide it) the supererogatory almsgiving (and give it to the poor) the folk of the Platform (ashab al-Suffah),(it will be better for you) than giving it in the open, but both are accepted from you, (and will atone forsome of your ill deeds) in proportion of your almsgiving. (Allah is Informed of what ye do). He knows of thealms that you give.
2|272|Then Allah gave dispensation to give alms to the poor among the idolaters and the people of the Book.Asma' the daughter of Abu Bakr, or Asma' the daughter of Abu'l-Nadir asked the Prophet: O Messenger ofAllah! Is it permissible to give alms to our relatives who do not follow our Religion? Allah answered HisProphet by saying: (The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad)) it is not your duty to guide toReligion the poor from among the people of the Book, (but Allah guideth whomever He will) to His religion.(And whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor, (it is for yourselves) its reward is foryourselves, (when ye spend) on the poor do (not) do so (save in search of Allah's Countenance) except inseeking Allah's pleasure; (and whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor among the folk of thePlatform, (it will be repaid to you in full) the reward of it will be saved for you in the Hereafter, (and ye willnot be wronged) your reward shall not be diminished and your sins will not be increased.
2|273|((Alms are) for the poor who are straitened) He says: alms are for those who confine themselves (for thecause of Allah) for the obedience of Allah in the Prophet's Mosque, i.e. the people of the Ledge, (who cannottravel in the land) for trade. (The unthinking man) the person who does not know them (accounteth themwealthy due to their restraint) because of their attire. (Thou shalt know them) O Muhammad! (by theirmark) by their clothing: (They do not beg of men with importunity) He says: they neither beg withimportunity nor without it. (And whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor among the people ofthe Ledge, (lo! Allah knoweth it) Allah knows your wealth as well as your intentions.
2|274|(Those who spend their wealth) in charity (by night and day, in secret and openly, surely their reward iswith their Lord) in Paradise, (and there shall no fear come upon them) perpetually (neither shall they grieve)when others do. This verse was revealed about 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib.
2|275|Allah then mentioned the punishment of consuming usury, saying: (Those who swallow usury) declaring it tobe lawful (cannot rise up) from their graves on the Day of Judgement (save as he ariseth) in the life of thisworld (whom the Devil hath prostrated) confounded (by (his) touch) of insanity. (That) confusion is, in theHereafter, the sign of the one who consumes usury (is because they say: Trade is just like usury) increase atthe end of selling, once the term is due, is like the increase at the beginning of a transaction when the saleis deferred; (whereas Allah permitteth trading) the former increase (and forbideth usury) the latter increase.(He unto whom and admonition from his Lord cometh) a prohibition of usury comes from his Lord, (and (he)refraineth (in obedience thereto)) from dealing in usury, (he shall keep (the profit) that which is past) heshall not be blamed for his dealing in usury before it was made unlawful, (and his affair (henceforth)) inwhat remains of his life (is with Allah) if He wishes He will protect him and if He wishes He will let him down.(As for him who returneth (to usury)) after usury has been made forbidden and says trade is just like usury(-such are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein) they will abide thereinuntil Allah wills.
2|276|If they are sincere (Allah hath blighted usury) He has wiped it out and removed its blessedness in the life ofthis world and in the Hereafter (and made) the obligatory and supererogatory (almsgiving fruitful) acceptedand rewarded many times over, when they are done sincerely for His sake. (Allah loveth not the impious)disbeliever who denies the unlawfulness of usury (and guilty) the impudent who consumes it.
2|277|(Lo! Those who believe) in Allah, His messengers, scriptures as well as in the unlawfulness of usury (and dogood works) regarding what is between them and their Lord and avoid usury (and establish worship)complete the five daily prayers with all that which is obligated in them (and pay the poor-due) and give thepoor-due of their wealth, (their reward is with their Lord) in Paradise (and there shall no fear come uponthem) when death is slain (neither shall they grieve) when the Fire is closed.
2|278|(O ye who believe!) the reference here is to the sons of 'Amr Ibn 'Umayr Ibn 'Awf al-Thaqafi, [and they werefour brothers:] Mas'ud [Ibn 'Amr], Hubayb [Ibn 'Amr], 'Abd Yalayl [Ibn 'Amr] and Rabi'ah [Ibn 'Amr](observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding usury, (and give up what remaineth (due to you) fromusury) leave that which the Banu Makhzum owe you of usury, (if ye are (in truth) believers) if you reallybelieve in the prohibition of usury.
2|279|(And if ye do not) if you do not abstain from usury, (then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and HisMessenger) then be ready for a torment from God in the Hereafter by means of the Fire and itschastisement and also be ready for the sword from His Messenger in the life of this world. (And if ye repent)from usury, (then ye have your principal (without interest)) that is owed to you by the Banu Makhzum.(Wrong not) anyone by demanding interest, (and ye shall not be wronged) by anyone if they give you backyour capitals; it is also said that 'wrong not' means: do not harm others; and 'you shall not be wronged'meaning: you shall not be harmed because of your debts.
2|280|(And if the debtor) the Banu Makhzum (is in straitened circumstances, then (let there be) postponement to(the time of) ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you) than being paid orpostponing the debt (if ye did but know) this.
2|281|(And guard yourselves against a day) fear the torment of a day (in which ye will be brought back to Allah.Then every soul) whether believing or disbelieving (will be paid full that which it hath earned) of good orevil, (and they will not be wronged) their rewards will not be decreased and their sins shall not be increased.
2|282|Allah then taught them what they ought to learn in their dealings, saying: (O ye who believe!) in Allah andHis Messenger (when ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it) i.e. the debt (in writing. Let a scriberecord it in writing between you) the indebted person and the creditor (in (terms of) equity) justice. (Noscribe should refuse to write) the contract between the creditor and the debtor (as Allah hath taught him)how to write, (so let him write) the contract without addition or omission, (and let him who incurreth thedebt dictate) i.e. the indebted person should explain to the scribe the debt he owes, (and let him observe hisduty to Allah his Lord) let the indebted person fear his Lord, (and diminish naught thereof) and not diminishany amount of debt he owes upon dictation. (But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding) isignorant of dictation, (or weak) unable to dictate, (or unable himself to dictate) does not know how todictate to the scribe, (then let the guardian of his interests dictate) the guardian of his wealth who is thecreditor (in (terms of) equity) without any addition. (And call to witness) for your rights, (from among yourmen, two witnesses) from among your free, Muslim men who are of good character. (And if two men be not(at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses) from among people who arereliable in their witness, (so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)) so that if one of the womenforgets (the other) who did not forget (will remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse) to give witness(when they are summoned) to court. (Be not averse) disinclined (to writing down) i.e. the debt (whether itbe small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That) i.e. that which I mentioned regarding the writingdown of the debt (is more equitable) more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah and more sure fortestimony) clearer for the witness when he gives his testimony if he happens to forget, (and the best way ofavoiding doubt between you) concerning the debt and the fixed term of its payment; (save only in the casewhen it is actual merchandise which you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is nosin) there is no harm (for you if ye write it not) the transaction. (And have witnesses when ye sell one toanother) on credit, (and let no harm be done to scribe) by committing the transaction to writing (or witness)by giving his witness, that is, do not coerce them to do so. (If ye do (harm to them)) if you harm them, (lo!It is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah for causing such harm. (Allah is teaching you) whatis best for you regarding your dealings. (And Allah is Knower of all things) what is good for you as well asother things.
2|283|(If ye be on a journey and you cannot find a scribe) or the means by which to write, (then a pledge in hand(shall suffice)) then let the creditor take from the indebted person a security for his loan. (And if one of youentrusteth another) to give a loan without security (let him who is trusted) with the debt (deliver up thatwhich is entrusted to him) the right of his creditor (and let him observe his duty to Allah, his Lord.) thedebtor should fear Allah regarding repayment of his debt, (Hide not testimony) from the judges in court. (Hewho hideth it) i.e. his testimony, (surely his heart is sinful) his heart is impious. (Allah is Aware of what yedo) in relation to hiding or giving testimony.
2|284|(Unto Allah (belongeth) whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings andmarvels; He commands His servants with whatever He wills; (and whether ye make known what is in yourminds) in your hearts; this refers to the discourse of the soul after the arousal of one's misgivings but beforeone divulges it (or hide it, Allah will bring you to account for it) Allah will requite you for it. The same appliesto forgetfulness after one remembers, error after being right and coercion after exerting one's effort freely.(He will forgive whom He will) He will forgive the one who repents of all sins (and He will punish whom Hewill) He will punish the one who does not repent. (And Allah is Able to do all things) in terms of forgivenessand punishment.
2|285|When the last verse was revealed, the believers found its content disconcerting. So when the Prophet(pbuh) ascended to heaven he prostrated to his Lord, and Allah said in praise of His Prophet: (TheMessenger believeth) the Messenger Muhammad (pbuh) believes (in that which hath been revealed untohim from his Lord) i.e. the Qur'an and its content, and then the Prophet (pbuh) said on behalf of his Lord(and (so do) the believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and Hismessengers-We make no distinction between any of His messengers-) they say: we do not disbelieve in anyof his messengers (and they say: We hear) the saying of our Lord, (and we obey) the command of our Lord,i.e. we hear and obey our Lord. The Prophet (pbuh) then said: ((Grant us) Thy forgiveness) forgive us forthe discourse of our souls, (our Lord) O our Lord! (Unto Thee is the journeying) unto you is the return afterdeath.
2|286|By way of response, Allah said: (Allah tasketh not a soul) in relation to acts of obedience (beyond its scope)beyond its capability. (For it (is only) that which it hath earned) of good, and of leaving the discourse of thesoul, forgetfulness, error and coercion, (and against it (only) that which it hath deserved) of evil, thediscourse of the soul, forgetfulness, and coercion. Allah taught the believers thereafter how they should prayto Him so as to lift the discourse of the soul, error, forgetfulness and coercion from them, saying that theyshould supplicate thus: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Condemn us not if we forget) to obey you, (or miss themark!) regarding your command (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lay not on us such a burden) a covenant which, ifwe fail to honour, You will prohibit us from wholesome things (as Thou didst) as You made it unlawful (onthose before us!) on the Children of Israel because they broke Your covenant regarding wholesome things:the meat of camels, the fat of bovines, small cattle and other things. (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Impose not onus that which we have not the strength to bear!) that in which there is no comfort or benefit for us, and thisis what is meant by coercion. (Pardon us) all this, (absolve us) from it (and have mercy on us) by means ofit. (Thou, our Protector) You are more deserving of protecting us; (and give us victory over the disbelievingfolk). It is also said that the meaning is as follows: (Pardon us) by not turning us into animals as you turnedsome of the people of Jesus into animals, (absolve us) from making the ground swallow us up as you madethe ground swallow up Korah (Qarun); (and have mercy on us) by not being tossed up by the waves as youdid to the people of Lot. When the believer called upon Allah with this supplication, Allah lifted from themthe discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, error, coercion and absolved them from being turned into animals,making the ground swallow them or being tossed by the waves. All those who follow in their footsteps willbe absolved from the same.
3|1|And on his authority he related from Ibn 'Abbas regarding the saying of Allah, Exalted is He: (Alif. Lam.Mim.) that he said: 'Allah informed us about the story of the delegation of Najran; it is also said that this isan oath by which Allah swore that He is One and that He has neither progeny nor partner.
3|2|(Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive) Who dies not and is not evanescent, (the Eternal) the Self-subsistent Who has no beginning.
3|3|(He hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture) He sent you Gabriel with the Scripture (with truth)in order to show truth from falsehood, (confirming) corroborating Allah's divine Oneness (that which was(revealed) before it) of scriptures, (even as He revealed the Torah) in one go to Moses the son of Amran(and the Gospel) in one go to the Jesus the son of Mary.
3|4|(Aforetime) before Muhammad and the Qur'an, (for a guidance to mankind) as a guidance from error to theChildren of Israel; (and hath revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong)) He revealed the Qur'an toMuhammad in instalments to differentiate the lawful from the unlawful. (Lo! those who disbelieve therevelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an, referring in this context to the delegation of Najran, (theirswill be a heavy doom) in this world and in the next. (Allah is Mighty) powerful in His vengeance, (Able toRequite (the wrong)) able to carry His vengeance out on them.
3|5|(Lo! nothing in the earth) of the story of the delegation of Najran (or in the heavens) concerning the angels(is hidden from Allah).
3|6|(He it is Who fashioneth you) creates you (in the wombs as pleaseth Him) short or tall, pretty or ugly, maleor female, felicitous or damned. (There is no God) there is no fashioner or creator (save Him, the Almighty)Who is vengeful against whoever does not believe in Him, (the Wise) in creating what is in wombs.
3|7|(He it is Who hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture) who sent you Gabriel with the Scripture(wherein are clear revelations) expositing the lawful and unlawful which are not abrogated and which areacted upon. (They are the substance of the Book) they are the foundation of the Book as they are theleading theme in each book. They are all acted upon. An example of this is the saying of Allah: (Say: Come,I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred duty for you...) [6:151]. (And others (whichare) allegorical) vague in their meanings to the Jews, like the use of the letters of the alphabet according totheir numerical value (hisab al-Jumal) in such instances as Alif. Lam. Mim, Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad, Alif. LamMim. Ra; and Alif. Lam. Ra; it is also said that (others (which are) allegorical) means: other verses that areabrogated and no longer acted upon. (But those) the Jews Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab andJudayy Ibn Akhtab (in whose hearts is doubt) scepticism, opposition and deviance from guidance (pursue,forsooth, that which is allegorical seeking) in the Qur'an ((to cause) dissension) pursuing disbelief, ascribingpartners to Allah, and holding fast to the error they are in (by seeking to explain it) to determine the futureof this nation so that dominion reverts back to them. (None knoweth its explanation) the future of thisnation (save Allah). Here Allah interrupts His speech and then resumes it by saying: (And those who are ofsound instruction) those who have a sound grasp of the knowledge of the Torah: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam andhis fellow companions (say: We believe therein) in the Qur'an; (the whole is from our Lord) Allah hasrevealed both those verses which are clear and those which are ambiguous; (but only men ofunderstanding) who have sound minds such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his fellow companions (really heed)take admonition from the simile of the Qur'an.
3|8|(Our Lord!) these also say: O our Lord! (Cause not our hearts to stray) do not make our hearts deviate fromYour Religion (after Thou hast guided us) to Your Religion, (and bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence)make us firm in holding to Your religion. (Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Bestower) to the believers before us;it is also said that this means: You are the Bestower of prophethood and Islam to Muhammad.
3|9|(Our Lord!) they say: O our Lord! (it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together) after they die (to a Day) on aday (of which there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst) resurrection after death, thereckoning, the Bridge over hell, the Scale, Paradise and hell.
3|10|((On that day) neither the riches) the abundance of riches (nor the progeny) nor the abundance of progeny(of those who disbelieve) i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his fellow companions; and it is also said that this refersto Abu Jahl and his companions (will aught avail them with Allah) will not avail them anything from Allah'storment. (They will be fuel for fire) they are the firewood of hell.
3|11|(Like Pharaoh's folk) like the work of the folk of Pharaoh. Allah says here: your people have done with you-by giving you the lie and abusing you-as the people of Moses did with him: they gave him the lie and abusedhim. And We (Allah) shall do with them on the Day of Badr as We did with the people of Moses on the dayof drowning, (and those who were before them) before the people of Moses, (they disbelieved Ourrevelations) they disbelieved in the Scripture and Messenger We sent to them (and so Allah seized them)destroyed them (for their sins) because of their denial. (And Allah is severe in punishment) when He doespunish.
3|12|(Say) O Muhammad! (unto those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca: (Ye shall be overcome) You shallbe killed on the Day of Badr (and gathered unto hell) on the Day of Judgement, (an evil resting place) anevil place and outcome.
3|13|(There was a token) a sign confirming the prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh) (for you) O people of Mecca(in two hosts) in two groups: that of Muhammad and that of Abu Sufyan (which met) on the Day of Badr:(one army fighting in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah: Muhammad and his Companions who were313 men, (and another disbelieving) and another group of disbelievers in Allah and the Messenger: AbuSufyan and his army which consisted of 950 men, (whom they saw) they saw themselves (as twice theirnumber) as twice the number as that of the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (clearly, with their veryeyes). It is also said that this can be understood in this way: Say, O Muhammad, to the unbelievers-theBanu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir-you shall be overcome and killed and expelled, and after you die, you willbe mustered in Gehenna, an evil abode and end. Allah informed them of this two years before the Battle ofBadr took place. Then He revealed: O Jews! You had a sign for the prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh) inthe form of two groups-that of Muhammad and that of Abu Sufyan-who met on the Day of Badr. One group(Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions) fought in obedience of Allah, and the other group consisted ofunbelievers in Allah and His Messenger (Abu Sufyan and his group). You saw with your very eyes, O Jews,that the unbelievers were twice the number of the Companions of Muhammad. (Thus Allah strengthenethwith His succour whom He will) i.e. Muhammad. (Lo! Herein) in Allah enabling Muhammad to triumph on theDay of Badr (verily is a lesson for those who have eyes) concerning Religion, i.e. the believers; it is also saidthat this means: it was a lesson for those who saw it with their own eyes.
3|14|Allah then mentions the bounties of the life of this world that He has made attractive for the unbelievers,saying: (Beautified for mankind is) what people's hearts find desirable is (love of the joys (that come) fromwomen) meaning slave women and wives (and offspring) slaves and children, (and stored up heaps)amassed wealth (of gold and silver) it is also said that this means: minted or engraved gold and silver, (andhorses branded (with their mark)) beautiful branded horses and grazing in pastures, (and cattle) i.e. sheep,cows and camels (and land) cultivation and cultivated lands. (That) which is mentioned above (is comfort ofthe life of the world) is of benefit to people in the life of this world and then it vanishes; it is also said thatthis means: the joys of this world last only for as long as the stuff of any home, a bowl, a plate and the like.(Allah! With Him is a more excellent abode) in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise, to whoever shun such joys.
3|15|Then Allah elucidated the bliss of the Hereafter, its permanence and favour, just as He exposited the joys ofthe life of this world, by saying: (Say) O Muhammad, to the unbelievers: (Shall I inform you of somethingbetter than that?) better than the embellishments of this world. (For those who keep from evil) keep fromdisbelief, ascribing partners to Allah and indecencies, in reference to Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (withtheir Lord, are Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) of wine, honey, milk andwater (flow, wherein they will abide for ever) they will dwell in Paradise: they shall neither die nor leave it(and pure companions) they have therein spouses who are spared menses and filth, (and contentment fromAllah) and the contentment of Allah is far greater than the bliss they enjoy. (Allah is Seer of His bondmen)He is Seer of the believers, their places in Paradise, as well as their works in the life of this world.
3|16|Allah then proceeds to describe them, saying: (Those who say) in the life of this world: (Our Lord!) O ourLord! (Lo! we believe) in You and in Your Messenger. (So forgive us our sins) that we committed in the pre-Islamic period as well as after the advent of Islam (and guard us from the punishment of Fire) drive awayfrom us the punishment of hell;
3|17|(The steadfast) in performing the obligations enjoined by Allah and in shunning contraventions against Him;it is also said that this means: the steadfast when misfortunes befall them, (and the Truthful) in their faith,(and the obedient) vis-�-vis Allah and His Messenger, (those who spend) their wealth in the way of Allah,(those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night) supererogatory prayers.
3|18|Allah declared then His divine Oneness, saying: (Allah (Himself) is witness) even if no one else bears witness(that there is no God save Him. And the angels) do also bear witness to that (and the men of learning) andthe prophets and the believers bear witness to that. (Maintaining His creation in justice, there is no God saveHim, the Almighty) in His vengeance against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) and He hascommanded that none shall be worshipped except Him.
3|19|(Lo! Religion) that is accepted (with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His will and guidance)). It is also said thatthis should be understood as: Allah bears witness that Religion with Him is Islam (the Surrender), and theangels, the prophets and the believers also bear witness to this. This verse was revealed about two menfrom Historic Syria who asked the Prophet (pbuh) which is the greatest witness in the Book of Allah. Whenhe informed them about it, they embraced Islam. (Those who (formerly) received the Scripture) the Jewsand Christians (differed) about Islam and Muhammad (only after knowledge) the exposition of what is intheir Scripture (came unto them, through transgression among themselves) out of resentful envy. (Whosodisbelieveth the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an ((will find that) Lo! Allah is swift atreckoning) severe in His punishment.
3|20|Allah then mentions their argument with the Prophet (pbuh) about the Religion of Islam, saying: (And ifthey) i.e. the Jews and Christians (argue with thee, O Muhammad, say: I have surrendered my purpose) Imake my Religion and works sincere (to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those whohave received the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (and those who read not) i.e. the Arabs: (Have ye (too)surrendered?) do you surrender as we have surrendered? Allah then said: (If they surrender) as you havesurrendered, (then truly they are rightly guided) from error, (and if they turn away) from surrender, (then itis your duty only to convey the message (unto them)) on behalf of Allah. (Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen)those who believe and those who do not.
3|21|(Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (and slay the Prophets) i.e.ally themselves with those who slay the prophets (wrongfully) without them having committed any crime,(and slay those of mankind) who believed in the prophets (who enjoin equity) Allah's divine Oneness:(promise them a painful doom) which will spread out to their hearts.
3|22|(Those are they whose works) good deeds (have failed) made void (in the world and the Hereafter) that is,they will not be given reward for them in the Hereafter; (and they have no helpers) who will save them fromAllah's punishment.
3|23|Allah mentions after this the rejection of stoning by the Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir from among thepeople of Khaybar, saying: (Hast thou not seen) O Muhammad! (how those who have received theScripture) were given knowledge about what is in the Torah regarding stoning and other things (invoke theScripture of Allah) the Qur'an ((in their disputes) that it may judge between them) about stoning the marriedman and married woman who committed adultery in Khaybar, as is in their Scripture; (then a faction ofthem) from Banu Qurayzah and the people of Khaybar (turn away) from the judgement, (being opposed (toit)) denying that judgement.
3|24|(That) opposition, denial and punishment (is because they say: The Fire will not touch us) in the Hereafter(save for a certain number of days) about 40 days. A group from among the Jews said: the Fire will nottouch us except for a limited number of days: seven days of days of the Hereafter-each day equalling athousand years-as punishment for the days in which our forefathers worshipped the calf. (That which theyused to invent has deceived them) their lie about not being punished; it is also said this refers to their claimthat punishment shall be postponed (regarding their religion) i.e. their firm adherence to their religion:Judaism.
3|25|(How (will it be with them)) how shall they act, O Muhammad, (when We have brought them all together)after they die (to a Day) on a day (of which there is no doubt, when every soul) righteous or sinner (will bepaid in full what it has earned) of good or evil, (and they will not be wronged) their good works will not bedecreased and their sins will not be increased.
3|26|(Say: O Allah!) say O Allah! Lead us to goodness (Owner of Sovereignty!) O Master of kings and Owner ofsovereignty (Thou givest sovereignty unto whom Thou wilt) i.e. unto Muhammad and his followers, (andThou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt) i.e. from the people of Persia and Byzantium. (Thouexaltest whom Thou wilt) i.e. Muhammad (and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy IbnSalul, the people of Persia and the people of Byzantium. (In Thy hand is the good) exaltation, abasement,sovereignty, spoils, triumph and power. (Lo! Thou art Able to do all things) whether it is exaltation,abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph or power. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy IbnSalul, the hypocrite, who said after the Conquest of Mecca: "How on earth can they have sovereignty overPersia and Byzantium?" It is also said that it was revealed about the Quraysh who said: "the king of Persiasleeps on couches made of silk brocade, if you are truly a prophet, show us your dominion?"
3|27|Then he showed Allah's might by saying: (Thou causest the night to pass into the day) You increase thelength of the day over the length of the night, such that the day is longer than the night, (and Thou causestthe day to pass into the night) You increase the length of the night over the length of the day, such that thenight is longer than the day. (And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead) He says: You bring forth aliving creature from a sperm drop, (and Thou bringest forth the dead from the living) and You bring forth asperm drop from man; it is also said that this verse means: You bring forth the living (a chicken) from thedead (an egg), and You bring forth the dead (a grain) from the living (a spike of grain). (And Thou givestsustenance to whom Thou choosest, without stint) without measure, exerting power or showing off Yourblessings; it is also said that this means: You give wealth in abundance to whomever You choose withoutstraitness or inconvenience.
3|28|(Let not the believers take) the believers ought not to take [the hypocrites:] 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and hiscompanions [and] (disbelievers) the Jews (for their friends) so as to become mighty and honourable (inpreference to believers) who are sincere. (Whoso doeth that) seeking might and honour [by taking thehypocrites and disbelievers as friends] (hath no connection with Allah) has no honour, mercy or protectionfrom Allah (unless (it be) that ye but guard yourselves against them) save yourselves from them, (taking (asit were) security) saving yourselves from them by speaking in a friendly way towards them with, while yourhearts dislikes this. (Allah bideth you beware (only) of Himself) regarding the shunning of unlawful killing,unlawful sex, unlawful property, consuming intoxicants, false testimony and associating partners with Allah.(Unto Allah is the journeying) the return after death.
3|29|(Say) O Muhammad!: (Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts) what is in your hearts of hatred andenmity towards Muhammad (pbuh) (or reveal it) by showing abuse, defamation and waging war, (Allahknoweth it) Allah will record it and requite for it. (He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which isin the earth) of good and evil, what is secret and what is revealed, (and Allah is Able to do all things)regarding the dwellers of the heavens and the dwellers of earth. This verse was revealed about thehypocrites and the Jews.
3|30|(On the day) the Day of Judgement (when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath done)written in its register (of good and all that it hath done of evil) it will also find it written in its register ((everysoul) will long that there might be a mighty apace of distance) a long period of time separating them: fromsunrise to sunset (between it and that (evil). Allah bideth you beware of Him) upon committing an act ofdisobedience. (And Allah is full of pity for (His) bondmen) He is full of pity for the believers.
3|31|(Say) O Muhammad!: (If ye love Allah) and His religion, (follow me) follow my Religion; (Allah will love you)He will increase your love (and forgive you your sins) which were committed when you followed Judaism.(Allah is Forgiving) of whoever repents, (Merciful) towards whoever dies in a state of repentance. This versewas revealed about the Jews who claimed they were the children of Allah and His beloved ones. When thisverse was revealed 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: "Muhammad is commanding us to love him as the Christiansloved Jesus", and the Jews said: "Muhammad wants us to take him as a compassionate Lord, just as theChristians took Jesus as a compassionate Lord".
3|32|Consequently, Allah revealed about their comments: (Say: Obey Allah) regarding what He has obligated(and the Messenger) in his practices. (But if they turn away) from obeying them, (Lo! Allah loveth not thedisbelievers) the Jews and the hypocrites.
3|33|When the Jews heard this, they said: "we follow the religion of Adam: we are Muslims", and so Allahrevealed the following: (Lo! Allah preferred Adam) with Islam (and Noah) with Islam (and the Family ofAbraham) the children of Abraham with Islam (and the Family of 'Imran) Moses and Aaron with Islam(above (all His) creatures) above all the people of their times. It is also said that Amran is not the father ofMoses and Aaron.
3|34|(They were descendants one of another) some follow the religion of others and the offspring of some arethe descendents of others. (Allah is Hearer) of what the Jews say: that they are Allah's children and belovedones and that they follow His religion, (Knower) of their punishment and of whom is following His religion.
3|35|Remember, O Muhammad (When the wife of Imran) Hannah, the mother of Mary (said: My Lord I havevowed unto Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering)) a servant at the Sanctuary ofJerusalem. (Accept it from me. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer) of prayers, (the Knower!) of the answerand of that which is in my womb.
3|36|(And when she was delivered) what was in her womb and it was a baby girl (she said: My Lord! Lo! I amdelivered of a female) a baby girl. (Allah knew best of what she was delivered. The male is not as thefemale) in service and weakness; (and Lo! I have named her Mary, and Lo! I crave Thy protection for her) Iseek for her Your protection and safety (and for her offspring from Satan the outcast) the accursed.
3|37|(And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance) He was good to her and accepted her instead of acceptinga boy (and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth) He nurtured her well in worship throughout the years,months, days and hours; (and made Zachariah her guardian) he joined her to him for training. (WheneverZachariah went into the sanctuary where she was) the room where she worshipped, (he found that she hadfood) the fruit of winter in the summer, such as culms of corn, and the fruits of summer in the winter suchas grapes. (He said: O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)?) how did you get this food out of itsseason? (She answered: It is from Allah) Gabriel brought it to me. (Allah giveth without stint) without pauseor measure (to whom He will) in its season or out of it.
3|38|(Then) at that point (Zachariah prayed unto) and wished from (his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow upon meof Thy bounty) from You (goodly offspring) a righteous child. (Lo! Thou art the Hearer of Prayer) You arethe One Who answers prayers.
3|39|(And the angels) i.e. the Angel Gabriel (called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary) in the mosque:(Allah giveth thee glad tidings of John) a son whose name is John, ((who cometh) to confirm a Word fromAllah) Jesus son of Mary that he will be a word from Allah, created without a father, (lordly) who is clementwhen wronged, (chaste) has no desire for women, (a Prophet of the righteous) among the messengers.
3|40|(He said: My Lord) Zachariah said to Gabriel: O master! (How can I have a son when age hath overtaken mealready) when I am very old (and my wife is barren) and cannot conceive children? ((The angel) answered:So (it will be)) as I have told you. (Allah doeth what He will).
3|41|(He) Zachariah (said: My Lord) O my Lord! (Appoint a token for me) regarding my wife's pregnancy. ((Theangel) said: The token unto thee) about your wife's pregnancy ((shall be) that thou shalt not speak) will notbe able to speak (unto mankind three days) without being dumb (except by signs) by moving your lips,eyebrows, eyes and hands; it is also said: except by writing on the ground. (Remember your Lord) with yourtongue and heart (much) in all circumstances, (and praise (Him) in the early hours of night and morning)pray in the morning and at night as you used to do.
3|42|(And when the angels) i.e. Gabriel (said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee) with Islam and worship (andmade thee pure) from disbelief, the association of partners with Allah and blemishes; it is also said thismeans: He has saved you from being killed, (and hath preferred you above (all) the women of creation) ofyour time by the birth of Jesus.
3|43|(O Mary! Be obedient to thy Lord) as a token of gratitude to Him; it is also said this means: prolong yourprayer as a token of gratitude to your Lord, (prostrate thyself and bow) meaning: and do also prostrate andbow (with those who bow (in worship)) with the people of worship.
3|44|(This) which I mentioned of the story of Mary and Zachariah (is of the tidings of things hidden) of the thingsthat were unknown to you, O Muhammad. (We reveal it unto thee (Muhammad)) He says: We send Gabrielwith it to you. (Thou wast not present with them) with the Rabbis (when they threw their pens) in the flowof water ((to know) which of them should be the guardian of Mary) to train her, (nor wast thou present withthem when they quarrelled (thereupon)) each giving argument for his better claim to be Mary's guardian.
3|45|((And remember) when the angels) i.e. Gabriel (said: O Mary! Allah giveth you glad tidings of a Word fromHim) of a son who shall come into being by means of a Word from Allah, (whose name is the Messiah)because he travels from one country to another; it is also said: the Messiah means the king, (Jesus, son ofMary, illustrious in the world) he has standing and position amidst people in the life of this world (and theHereafter) he has standing and position with Allah, (and one of those brought near) unto Allah in the Gardenof Eden.
3|46|(He will speak unto mankind in his cradle) in the lap of his mother, saying: I am the servant of Allah and HisMessiah (and in his manhood) after he reaches 30 years old, saying that he is a prophet, (and he is of therighteous) of the messengers.
3|47|(She said: My Lord!) Mary said to Gabriel: O master!: (How can I have a child) how is it possible for me tohave a child (when no mortal hath touched me?) lawfully or unlawfully? (He) Gabriel (said: So (it will be)) asI have told you. (Allah createth what He will. If He decreeth a thing) if He wills to create a son from youwithout a father, (He saith unto it only: Be! and it is) a son without a father.
3|48|(And He will teach him the Scripture) the Scriptures of [past] prophets; as it is said: writing (and wisdom)the lawful and the prohibited; as it said this means: the wisdom of the prophets who preceded him, (and theTorah) in the womb of his mother (and the Gospel) after he came out of his mother's womb.
3|49|(And will make him a messenger) after the age of thirty (unto the Children of Israel), and when he went tothem he said: (Lo! I come unto you with a sign) a token (from your Lord) for my prophethood. They said:what is this sign? He replied: (Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it)like the breathing of a sleeping person (and it is a bird) flying in the air, (by Allah's leave) by Allah'scommand. Then he fashioned for them a bat and when it became alive, they said: this is sorcery; do youhave another sign? He said: yes, (I heal him who was born blind, and the leper) also, (and I raise the dead,by Allah's leave) by Allah's greatest Name: O Alive, the Eternal. And when he did this, they said: this issorcery, do you have any other sign? He said: yes, (And I announce unto you what you eat) in the morningand at night (and what you store up in your houses) what you save from your lunch to dinner and from yourdinner to the next day's lunch. (Lo! Herein) in that which I have told you (verily is a portent) a sign (for you,if ye are believers) who have faith.
3|50|(And (I come) confirming) and I have come confirming Allah's divine Oneness in the Religion (that whichwas before me of the Torah) and all other Scriptures, (and to make lawful) to give you legal dispensationregarding (some of that which was forbidden unto you) such as the meat of camels, the fat of bovines andsheep, the Sabbath, and other things. (I come unto you with a sign) with a token (from your Lord, so keepyour duty to Allah) so fear Allah in that which He has commanded you with and repent to Him (and obeyme) and follow my command and Religion;
3|51|(Lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him) declare his divine Oneness. (That) divine Oneness (is astraight path) an established religion, Islam, which He is pleased with.
3|52|(But when Jesus became conscious) when he knew (of their disbelief) and saw that they wanted to kill him;it is also said: when he repeatedly heard their disbelief, (he) Jesus (cried: Who will be my helpers in thecause of Allah?) against His enemies. (The disciples) his closest disciples who were 12 in number (said: Wewill be Allah's helpers) against his enemies. (We believe in Allah, and bear thou witness) Know, O Jesus(that we have surrendered (unto Him)) we acknowledge Allah by worshipping Him and declaring His divineOneness.
3|53|(Our Lord) O our Lord! (We believe in that which Thou hast revealed) of the Scripture, i.e. the Gospel (andwe follow him whom Thou hast sent) the religion of the Messenger Jesus. (Enrol us among those whowitness) make us among the first forerunners who were witnesses before us; it is also said this means:make us of the community of Muhammad (pbuh).
3|54|(And they schemed) they, i.e. the Jews, planned to kill Jesus, (and Allah schemed (against them)) Allahwished to kill their man Tatianos: (and Allah is the best of schemers) the strongest of those who have a will;it is also said this means: the best of Makers.
3|55|((And remember) when Allah said: O Jesus! Lo! I am gathering thee and causing thee to ascend unto Me,and am cleansing) saving (thee of those who disbelieve) in you (and am setting those who follow you)follow your Religion (above those who disbelieve) with strong argument and triumph (until the Day ofResurrection) then I shall make you to die after descent; it is also said this means: I shall make your heartdie to the love of the life of this world. (Then unto Me ye will (all) return) after death, (and I shall judgebetween you as to that wherein) in religion (ye used to differ) to argue.
3|56|(As for those who disbelieve) in Allah and in His messengers Muhammad and Jesus (I shall chastise themwith a heavy chastisement in the world) by exposing them to the sword and the capitation tax (jizyah) (andthe Hereafter) by throwing them into the Fire; (and they will have no helpers) to save them from Allah'spunishment in this world or in the Hereafter.
3|57|(And as for those who believe) in Allah, the Scripture and His messengers Muhammad and Jesus (and dogood works) sincerely between them and their Lord, (He will pay them their wages in full) He will pay themtheir reward on the Day of Judgement. (Allah loveth not wrong-doers) the idolaters, with theirtransgressions and association of partners with Allah.
3|58|(This) that I have told you about, O Muhammad, regarding the story of Jesus ((which) We recite unto thee)with which We send Gabriel to you (is a revelation) He says: they are revelations of the Qur'an, conveyingcommands and prohibitions (and a wise reminder) that enjoins what is lawful and what is unlawful; it is alsosaid this means: it corroborates the Torah and the Gospel; and it is also said this means: it confirms thatwhich is in the Guarded Tablet.
3|59|Allah then explained the creation of Jesus without a father because the delegation of Najran asked theProphet to provide proof from the Qur'an for his saying that Jesus was not the son of Allah, so Allah said:(Lo! the likeness of Jesus) the likeness of the creation of Jesus (with Allah) without a father (is as thelikeness of Adam. He created him of dust) without a father or mother, (then He said unto him) to Jesus:(Be! and he is) a son without a father.
3|60|((This is) the Truth) this is the true fact (from your Lord) that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner,(so be not thou of those who waver) those who doubt what I have exposited to you regarding the creationof Jesus without a father.
3|61|Allah then mentioned the dispute of the delegation of Najran with the Prophet (pbuh) after he explained tothem that the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam, for they said to the Prophet: it is not asyou say that Jesus was not Allah, his son or His partner. As response Allah said: (And whoso disputeth withthee concerning him) concerning Jesus, (after the knowledge which has come unto thee) after theexposition that has come to you that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner, (say (unto him): Come! Wewill summon our sons and your sons) and you summon your sons, (and our women and your women) andyou summon your women, (and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord)) and exertour effort in praying ((and (solemnly) invoke) all together (the curse of Allah upon those who lie) about Allahconcerning Jesus.
3|62|(Lo! This) which We have mentioned, O Muhammad, regarding Jesus and the delegation of Najran (verily isthe true narrative) the true fact that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner. (There is no God saveAllah) without a son or partner, (and lo! Allah is the Mighty) Who is vengeful against those who do notbelieve in Him, (the Wise) Who has commanded that none should be worshipped except Him; it is also said(the Wise) means: Allah ruled that they should go out and invoke His curse on those who lie, but thedelegation of Najran refused to do so because they knew they were liars and that Muhammad was a trueProphet and emissary whose traits and description were to be found in their own Scripture.
3|63|(And if they turn away) from joining the Prophet (pbuh) in invoking Allah's curse on those who lie about Himregarding Jesus (then Lo! Allah is Aware of (who are) the corrupters) i.e. the Christians of Najran.
3|64|After this, Allah invited them to accept Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (Say: O People of the Scripture. Cometo an agreement) the agreement is: there is no god except Allah (between us and you: that we shall worshipnone but Allah) we shall declare Allah as the only One God, (and that we shall ascribe no partners unto Him)from among created beings, (and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah) that none of usshall obey another person in that which involves a transgression against Allah. (And if they turn away) andrefuse to accept Allah's divine Oneness, (then say: Bear witness) know (that we are they who havesurrendered (unto Him)) and acknowledge His divine Oneness and worship Him.
3|65|Then Allah mentions their dispute with the Prophet (pbuh) in that they said they are of those who havesurrendered to Allah and follow the Religion of Abraham, claiming this to be in the Torah. So Allah said: (OPeople of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were notrevealed till after him?) after Abraham. (Have ye then no sense?) that it is not mentioned in them thatAbraham was Jew or Christian.
3|66|(Lo! Ye) O Jews and Christians (are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge) in yourScripture that Muhammad is a prophet sent by Allah and that Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian, butyou rejected this: (Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge) from your Scriptureand say that Abraham was Jew or Christian? (Allah knoweth) that Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian.(Ye know not) that he was Jew or Christian.
3|67|Allah then denied their claim, saying: (Abraham was not a Jew) following the religion of the Jews, (nor yet aChristian) following the religion of the Christians; (but he was an upright man who had surrendered (toAllah)) sincerely, (and he was not of the idolaters) who adhered to their religions.
3|68|Then Allah showed who follows the Religion of Abraham, saying: (Lo! those of mankind who have the bestclaim to Abraham) to the Religion of Abraham (are those who followed him) in his time, (and this Prophet)Muhammad follows his Religion (and those who believe) in Muhammad and in the Qur'an also follow theReligion of Abraham; (and Allah is the Protecting Friend of the believers) He protects them and helps them.
3|69|Allah mentions, then, how Ka'b al-Ashraf invited some of the companions of Allah's Messenger (pbuh)-Mu'adh [Ibn Jabal], Hudhayfa [Ibn al-Yaman] and 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir]-to join their religion (Judaism) andleave Islam, after the Battle of Uhud, saying: (A party of the people of the Scripture long to make you goastray) from your Religion, Islam; (and they make none to go astray) from the religion of Allah (exceptthemselves, but they perceive not) this; it is also said that this means: they perceive not that Allah informsHis Prophet of this.
3|70|(O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve you in the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an,(when you (yourselves) bear witness (to the Truth)?) you know from your Scripture that Muhammad is aprophet sent by Allah.
3|71|(O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood) you confound the traits of the anti-Christwith those of Muhammad (and knowingly conceal the Truth?) the traits and description of Muhammad whichyou find in your Scripture.
3|72|Allah mentions then what Ka'b and his followers said about the change of the Qiblah, saying: (And a party ofthe People of the Scripture) Ka'b and his fellow leaders (say) to the lowly among people: (Believe in thatwhich hath been revealed, unto those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (at the opening of theday) at the beginning of the Day, at the Dawn prayer, (and disbelieve at the end thereof) at the Zuhrprayer. In other words, they say: believe in the Qiblah towards which Muhammad and his Companionsprayed at the Dawn prayer and disbelieve in the other Qiblah towards which they prayed at the Zuhr prayer,(in order that they may return) in order that their communality may return to your religion and Qiblah;
3|73|(And believe not) that he is a prophet (save in one who followeth your religion) Judaism, and your Qiblah,Jerusalem. (Say) to the Jews, O Muhammad: (Lo! the guidance is Allah's guidance) Allah's Religion is Islamand Allah's Qiblah is the Ka'bah, (that any one is given) of Religion and Qiblah (the like of that which wasgiven unto you) O Companions of Muhammad (or that they may argue with you) that the Jews argue withyou regarding this Religion and Qiblah (in the presence of their Lord) on the Day of Judgement. (Say) also,O Muhammad: (Lo! the bounty) prophethood, Islam and the Qiblah of Abraham (is in Allah's hand. Hebestoweth it on whom He will) Muhammad and his Companions. (Allah is All- Embracing) in His bounty, (All-Knowing) to whom He gives.
3|74|(He selecteth for His mercy) He chooses for His religion (whom He will) Muhammad and his Companions.(Allah is of Infinite Bounty) He is generous towards Muhammad by bestowing upon him prophethood andIslam.
3|75|Subsequently, Allah mentions the trustworthiness and treachery of the people of the Book, saying: (Amongthe People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews (there is he who, if you trust him with a weight of treasure, willreturn it to you) without any problem, hardship or ever thinking to keep it for himself by declaring it lawfulfor him to take. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions. (And among them there ishe who, if you trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to you) and will declare it lawful for him totake (unless you keep standing over him) insisting on taking it back and suing him for it. The reference hereis to Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his followers. (That) treachery and declaring that it is lawful to take otherpeople's property (is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles) there is no harm in taking theproperty of Arabs. (They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly) they lie about Allah and know that they arelying.
3|76|(Nay) Allah is here answering them, (but (the chosen of Allah is) he who fulfileth his pledge) He says: but hewho keeps his pledge between himself and his Lord or between himself and other people (and wardeth off(evil)) ward off breaking his pledge by treachery and turning on his pledge; (for lo! Allah loveth those whoward off (evil)) ward off breaking pledges, treachery and being untrustworthy.
3|77|Allah then mentioned their punishment, i.e. the punishment of the Jews, saying: (Lo! those who purchase asmall gain) a small gain of in their living (at the cost of Allah's covenant) by breaking Allah's covenant (andtheir oaths) their pledges with their prophets, (they have no portion in the Hereafter) in Paradise. (Allah willneither speak to them) in a nice manner on the Day of Judgement (nor look upon them on the Day ofResurrection) He will have no mercy for them, (nor will He make them grow) He will neither exonerate themfor being Jews nor put their minds at peace. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a severe pain which will spreadto their hearts. It is also said that this was revealed about 'Abdan Ibn al-Ashu' and Imra' al-Qays because ofa dispute between them, and it was also revealed about the Jews.
3|78|(And Lo! there is) of the Jews (a party of them) Ka'b and his fellow men (who distort the Scripture with theirtongues) by reading the traits of the anti-Christ in their Scripture, (that ye may think) that the lowly maythink (that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is not from the Scripture. And they say: It is fromAllah) in the Torah, (when it is not from Allah) in the Torah; (and they speak a lie concerning Allahknowingly) fully aware that this is not in their Scripture.
3|79|Then Allah said as regards their claim that they follow the Religion of Abraham and that Abrahamcommanded them to follow this Religion: (It is not (possible) for any human being) among the prophets(unto whom Allah had given the Scripture and wisdom) understanding (and the prophethood that he shouldafterwards have said unto mankind: Be slaves of me instead of Allah; but (what he said was): Be you faithfulservants of the Lord) men of knowledge, people of understanding as well as people who put what they learninto practice (by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture) from the Scripture; it is also said that thismeans: by virtue of your knowledge of the Scripture (and of your constant study thereof) of your readingfrom the Scripture.
3|80|(And he commanded you) O people of the Quraysh, Jews and Christians (not that ye should take the angels)as daughters of Allah (and the Prophets for lords. Would he command you to disbelieve) how could Abrahamcommand you to follow disbelief (after ye had surrendered (to Allah)) after he commanded you to followIslam (completely Surrendering to Allah), saying to you: (Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) Religion;therefore die not save as men who have surrendered [2:132]). Allah says here: Allah has not sent aMessenger except that He commanded him to follow Islam and not Judaism, Christianity or the worship ofidols, as these unbelievers claim. It is also said that this verse was revealed about the claims of the Jewsthat Muhammad commanded them to love him and worship him as the Christians worshipped Jesus. TheChristians and idolaters also made the same claim.
3|81|Allah then explained His covenant with the prophets on the day of "Yes, indeed!" regarding Muhammad'straits and description, saying: (When Allah made (His) covenant with the Prophets) He says: Allah made acovenant with the prophets that they will show to one another the traits, description and merit ofMuhammad, ((He said): Behold that which I have given ye) when I did give you (of the Scripture andknowledge) containing details of the lawful and the unlawful. (And) you also made a covenant with yournation that (afterward there will come unto you a messenger, confirming) by calling to Allah's divineOneness (that which ye possess) of Scripture. (Ye shall believe in him) He says: you shall acknowledge himand his virtue (and ye shall help him) with the sword against his enemies and also by expositing his trait.(He said: Do ye agree?) Allah asked them whether they accepted (and will you take My burden) Mycovenant (in this) what I said? (They) the prophets (answered: We agree) we accept. (He) Allah (said: Thenbear ye witness) of this. (I will be a witness with you) of this also. Allah thus made them witnesses of oneanother and He Himself is a witness. And so each prophet explained this to his nation, and each prophetmade the members of his nation witnesses for each other, just as each prophet bore witness to it.
3|82|(Then whosoever after this) the covenant (shall turn away) from among the nations: (they will bemiscreants) who have broken the covenant and are unbelievers.
3|83|Allah then mentions the dispute of the Jews and Christians and the question which they put to the Prophet(pbuh) regarding who really follows the religion of Abraham. When the Prophet (pbuh) told them that theywere both far from the Religion of Abraham, they said that they did not accept this judgement. Hence, Allahsaid: (Seek they) with you (other than the religion of Allah) Islam (complete surrender to Allah), (when untoHim submiteth) acknowledges Islam and Allah's divine Oneness (whosoever is in the heavens) of angels(and the earth) of believers, (willingly) the dwellers of the heavens willingly, (or unwillingly) the dwellers ofthe earth unwillingly. It is also said that this means: the sincere among the believers acknowledge thiswillingly while the hypocrites do so unwillingly; it is also said this means: those who are born Muslimacknowledge this willingly while those who were made to embrace Islam do so unwillingly, (and unto Himthey will be returned) after death.
3|84|Allah then proceeds to explain the status of faith so that this serves for them as an indication to faith,saying: (Say) O Muhammad: (We believe in Allah) alone without any partner (and that which is revealedunto us) and in that which the Qur'an has revealed to us (and that which was revealed unto Abraham) andwe believe in Abraham and his Scripture (and Ishmael) and his Scripture (and Isaac) and his Scripture (andJacob) and his Scripture (and the tribes) the Children of Jacob and their scriptures, (and that which wasvouchsafed unto Moses) and we believe in Moses and his Scripture (and Jesus) and his Scripture (and theProphets) and we believe in all the prophets and their scriptures (from their Lord. We make no distinctionbetween any of them) we do not disbelieve in any of the prophets; it is also said this means: we do notdisassociate any one of them from Allah in relation to prophethood and Islam, (and unto Him we havesurrendered) we acknowledge His worship and divine Oneness and we are sincere to him in Religion.
3|85|(And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender (to Allah) it will not be accepted from him, and hewill be a loser in the Hereafter) he will be among the duped because he will miss Paradise and all that is in itand dwell in hell with all that is in it.
3|86|(How shall Allah guide) to His religion (a people who disbelieved) in Allah (after their belief and (after) theybore witness that the messenger) Muhammad (is true and after clear proofs (of Allah's sovereignty)) theexposition of the Truth and the Book (had come unto them. And Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk) theidolaters and those who are not fit for His religion.
3|87|(As for such, their reward is that on them rests the curse of Allah) the punishment of Allah (and of angels)and the curse of the angels (and of men combined) and the curse of the believers.
3|88|(They will abide therein) in the curse. (Their doom will not be lightened, neither will they be reprieved) theirpunishment will not be deferred;
3|89|(Save those who afterward) after their apostasy (repent) from disbelief and hypocrisy (and do right)sincerely declare Allah's divine Oneness. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent among them, (Merciful)towards those who die in a state of repentance.
3|90|(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Allah (after their (profession of) belief) in Allah, (and afterward grow violent indisbelief) do not waver in their disbelief: (their repentance will not be accepted) as long as they remain inthat state. (And such are those who are astray) from guidance and Islam.
3|91|(Lo! Those who disbelieve) in Allah and His Messenger, (and die in disbelief) disbelieving in Allah and HisMessenger, (the (whole) earth) the weight of the earth (full of gold would not be accepted from such an oneif it were offered as a ransom). Allah says: If they were to give the equivalent of the earth's weight in goldto ransom themselves, it would not be accepted from them. (Theirs will be a painful doom) which will extendto their hearts (and they will have no helpers) anyone to save them from Allah's punishment. The versesfrom (Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief.... Theirs will be a painful doom and they willhave no helpers) were revealed about ten hypocrites, namely, Tu'mah and his companions, who left Medinato Mecca as apostates from their religion, Islam. Some of them died as apostates, some were killed whilesome later returned to the fold of Islam.
3|92|Allah then prompted the believers to spend in the cause of Allah, saying: (Ye will not attain unto piety) i.e.that which is with Allah of reward, honour and Paradise until you spend of that which you love of property; itis also said this means: you shall not attend to reliance in Allah and God-fearingness (until ye spend of thatwhich ye love. And whatsoever ye spend) of property, (Allah is aware thereof) just as He is aware of yourintentions, i.e. whether you intend with it His Countenance or other people's praise.
3|93|(All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel) all food that is lawful for Muhammad and his communitytoday was lawful for the Children of Israel, the sons of Jacob, (save that which Israel) Jacob (forbadehimself) by the way of vows, ((in days) before the Torah was revealed) before the revelation of the Torah toMoses, Jacob forbade himself the meat and milk of camels. When this verse was revealed, the Prophet(pbuh) asked the Jews: "What did Jacob forbid himself of food?" They said: "he did not forbid himself anytype of food, and whatever is forbidden for us today, such as the meat of camels and other things, wasalready forbidden on all prophets, from Adam to Moses (pbut). It is only you who make such things lawful".And they claimed those things were also forbidden in the Torah. Hence Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh):(Say) to them: (Produce the Torah and read it (unto us)) where they are made forbidden (if ye are truthful)in your claim. But they failed to produce the Torah and knew they were liars since there was nothing in theTorah to substantiate their claim.
3|94|Therefore Allah said: (And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that) after the exposition in the Torahshow them to be liars (concerning Allah, such will be wrong-doers) unbelievers who lie about Allah.
3|95|(Say) O Muhammad: (Allah speaketh truth) when He said Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian; it isalso said this means: Say, O Muhammad, Allah has said the Truth regarding what He stated concerning thatwhich is lawful and that which is unlawful. (So follow the religion of Abraham, the upright) i.e. the Muslim.(He was not of the idolaters) who followed their Religion.
3|96|(Lo! the first Sanctuary) mosque (appointed for mankind) for the believers (was that at Becca) where theKa'bah is, (a blessed place) that the spot where the Ka'bah is built contains forgiveness and mercy, (aguidance to the peoples) it is a Qiblah to every prophet, messenger, veracious one (siddiq) and believer;
3|97|(Wherein are plain memorials) clear signs; and it contains (the place where Abraham stood up to pray) aswell as the semi-circular wall of white marble (Hatim) of Ishmael and the black stone; (and whosoeverentereth it is safe) from violence. (And to the House) going to the House (is a duty unto Allah for mankind)for the believers, (for him who can find a way thither) for the person who can walk and reach the Housewhile at the same time being in possession of provisions, a mount and has left enough expenditure for hisdependents until he returns. (As for him who disbelieveth) in Allah, Muhammad, the Qur'an and theobligation of pilgrimage, (Lo! Allah is Independent of (all) creatures) He is not in need of their belief orpilgrimage.
3|98|(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah) i.e. in Muhammad and theQur'an, (when Allah (Himself) is Witness of what ye do) of disbelief, by concealing [the Truth] and engagingin sins?
3|99|(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers) in Allah, Muhammad and the Qur'an (from theway of Allah) from the Religion of Allah and His worship, (seeking to make it crooked, when you arewitnesses?) when you know it to be in the Scripture. (Allah is not unaware of what ye do) Allah is notoblivious to your disbelief: concealing the Truth and committing transgressions. This verse was revealedabout those who invited 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir] and his fellow Muslims to join their religion: Judaism.
3|100|(O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the Scripture) the Torah (they will makeyou disbelievers) in Allah and Muhammad (after your belief) in Allah and [the message of] Muhammad.
3|101|(How can ye disbelieve) in Allah. This is mentioned by way of amazement, (when it is ye unto whom Allah'srevelations) the Qur'an containing commands and prohibitions (are recited, and His messenger) Muhammad(is in your midst?) with you. (He who holdeth fast to Allah) he who adheres to Allah's Religion and His Book,(he indeed is guided unto a right path) he is directed along a clear, solid way, which is Islam; it is also saidthis means: he has become firm on this way. This verse was revealed about Mu'adh [Ibn Jabal] and hiscompanions.
3|102|Thereafter, Allah spoke about a dispute between the Aws and the Khazraj, in which Tha'labah Ibn Ghanamand As'ad Ibn Zurarah boasted about their killings and raids on their rivals in the pre-Islamic days, saying:(O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah) obey Allah (with right observance) such that one obeys Himand never contravenes against Him, thank Him and never be ungrateful to him, remember Him and neverforget Him; it is also said this means: obey Allah as He ought to be obeyed, (and die not save as those whohave surrendered (unto Him)) sincerely acknowledging that you worship Him and declare His divineOneness;
3|103|(And hold fast, all of you together, to the cable of Allah) hold fast to the Religion of Allah and His Book, (anddo not separate) in religion. (And remember Allah's favour unto you) by giving you Islam: (how ye wereenemies) before Islam (and He made friendship between your hearts) through Islam (so that ye became asbrothers by His grace) by His religion, Islam; (and (how) ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire) i.e.because of disbelief, (and He did save you from it) by means of faith. (Thus Allah maketh clear Hisrevelations) His commands, prohibitions and favours (unto you, that haply ye may be guided) from error.
3|104|Allah then commanded goodness and reconciliation, saying: (And there may spring from you) there stillexists among you (a nation) a group (who invite to goodness) who invite to reconciliation and excellence,(and enjoin right conduct) they enjoin Allah's divine Oneness and the following of Muhammad (pbuh) (andforbid indecency) they forbid disbelief, idolatry and rejection, instead following the Messenger. (Such arethey who are successful) who are saved from Allah's wrath and punishment.
3|105|(And be ye not) divided in religion (as those who separated and disputed) in religion, such as the religiousschisms that took place among the Jews and Christians (after the clear proofs) proofs from their Scripturesof Islam (had come unto them. For such) i.e. the Jews and Christians (there is an awful doom) greater thananything one can imagine.
3|106|(On the day (some) faces will be whitened and (some) faces will be blackened; and as for those whose faceshave been blackened it will be said unto them) the angels in-charge of hell will say to them: (Disbelieved ye)in Allah (after your (profession of) belief?) in Allah. (Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved) inAllah.
3|107|(As for those whose faces have been whitened, Lo! in the mercy of Allah) in Allah's Paradise (they dwell forever) never to die or leave it.
3|108|(These are revelations of Allah): the Qur'an. (We recite them unto thee) We send them with Gabriel to you(in truth) in order to show what is true and what is an error. (Allah willeth no injustice to (His) creatures) Hedoes not will to be unjust to the jinn or human beings.
3|109|(Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings andmarvellous things; (and unto Allah all things are returned) in the Hereafter.
3|110|(Ye are the best community that has been raised up for mankind) that ever was for mankind. Allah thenshowed how they were the best community that has been raised for mankind saying: (Ye enjoin rightconduct) you enjoin the divine Oneness of Allah and the following of Muhammad (and forbid indecency) youforbid disbelief, idolatry and the opposition of the Messenger; (and ye believe in Allah) as well as in allrevealed scriptures and messengers. (And if the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews and Christians (hadbelieved it had been better for them) than what they are in now. (Some of them are believers) 'Abdullah IbnSalam and his followers; (but most of them are evil-livers) unbelievers who break their pledges.
3|111|(They will not harm you) the Jews will not harm you (save a trifling hurt) with their tongue by vilifying anddefaming you, (and if they fight against you) in Religion (they will turn and flee) defeated. (And afterwardthey will not be helped) they will not be saved from your swords or from being taken as captives.
3|112|(Ignominy shall be their portion) the humiliation of Jizyah shall be imposed upon them (wheresoever theyare found) they cannot stand against the believers (save (where they grasp) a rope from Allah) except ifthey believe in Allah (and a rope from men) or take a pledge with the rulers to pay the Jizyah. (They haveincurred anger) they deserved anger (from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them) the attire ofpoverty was imposed upon them. (That) ignominy (is because they used to disbelieve the revelations ofAllah) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (and slew the Prophets wrongfully) i.e. without the prophets havingcommitted any crime. (That) anger and humiliation (is because they were rebellious) against Allah on theSabbath (and used to transgress) by killing the prophets and take as lawful things that were prohibited.
3|113|(They are not all alike) i.e. those who believed from among the people of the Book are not like those amongthem who have not. (Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community) He says: there areamong them a group of upright people who are guided by Allah's divine Oneness: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam andhis followers (who recite the revelations of Allah) the Qur'an (in the night season) in the hours of the nightin their prayer, (falling prostrate (before Him)) praying to Allah.
3|114|(They believe in Allah) and in all the Scriptures and messengers (and the Last Day) they believe inresurrection after death as well as in the bliss of Paradise, (and enjoin right conduct) they enjoin Allah'sdivine Oneness and the following of Muhammad (and forbid indecency) disbelief, idolatry and the followingof sorcery and the leaders of misguidance, (and vie one with another in good works) they hasten to performgood works. (They are of the righteous) of the righteous among the community of Muhammad in Paradise,such as Abu Bakr and his fellow believers.
3|115|(And whatever good) that was mentioned above; and it is also said: whatever act of excellence they performtowards Muhammad and his Companions (they do) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, (they will notbe denied the meed thereof) its reward will not be forgotten and they shall indeed be rewarded for it. (Allahis Aware of those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecency-the reference here being to'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers.
3|116|(Lo! the riches) the abundance of riches (and the progeny) and the abundance of progeny (of those whodisbelieve) in Muhammad and in the Qur'an, i.e. Ka'b [Ibn al-Ashraf] and his followers (will not avail themaught against Allah) will not avail them against the punishment of Allah; (and such are rightful owners of theFire) the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein) for ever.
3|117|(The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world) He says: the likeness of what the Jews spendwhen they are following Judaism (is as the likeness of a biting, icy wind which smites the harvest of a peoplewho have wronged themselves) by not giving what is due to Allah from it, (and devastateth it) ruined it;likewise, idolatry destroys one's spending just as wind destroys the harvest. (Allah wronged them not) bythwarting the benefit of their harvest and spending, (but they did wrong themselves) through disbelief andwithholding what is due to Allah from the harvest.
3|118|Allah then forbade the believers from among the Helpers to speak with the Jews or divulge secrets to them,saying: (O ye who believe! Take not) the Jews (for intimates) confidants (others than your own folk) thesincere believers, (who would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you) they love for you to sinand become idolaters as they themselves have become. (Hatred is revealed by (the utterance of) theirmouths) through vilification and defamation, (but that which their breasts hide is greater) but what theyhide in their hearts of hatred and enmity is even greater. (We have made plain for you the revelations) thesigns of their resentful envy (if you will understand) what is recited to you; it is also said that this means:We have made the revelations, i.e. the commands and prohibitions, clear so that you know what I commandyou.
3|119|(Lo! Ye are) O group of believers (those who love them) who love the Jews because of the ties of marriageand suckling (though they love you not) because of the Religion, (and ye believe in all the Scripture) youacknowledge all the revealed Books and messengers while they do not. (When they) the hypocrites amongthe Jews (fall in with you they say: We believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an and we acknowledge that histraits and description are in our Scripture; (but when they go apart) and meet with each other (they bitetheir finger tips at you, for rage. Say: Perish in your rage! Lo! Allah is Aware of what is hidden in (your)breasts) He is Aware of what is in your heart of hatred and enmity.
3|120|(If a lucky chance) conquest and booty (befall you, it is evil unto them) the Jews and hypocrites do not likeit, (and if disaster) drought, killing and defeat (strike you they rejoice thereat) they like it. (But if youpersevere) in the face of their harm (and keep from evil) transgressing against Allah (their guile) theirenmity and deeds (will never harm you. Lo! Allah is Surrounding) Allah knows (what they do) ofcontravention and enmity.
3|121|(And remember when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk) when you left Medina for Uhud(to assign to the believers their positions for the battle) against their enemies, (Allah was Hearer) of yourspeech, (Knower) of what befell you and of your leaving the positions which were assigned to you.
3|122|(When two parties of you almost) two tribes of believers, the Banu Salamah and Banu Harithah, hid the factthat they almost (fell away) shrank away from fighting against the enemy on the Day of Uhud, (and Allahwas their Protecting Friend) He preserved them and prevented them from doing so. (In Allah do believersput their trust) the believers ought to put their trust in Allah when it comes to help and conquest.
3|123|(Allah had already given you the victory at Badr) on the day of the Battle of Badr, (when ye werecontemptible) few in number: 313 men. (So observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding the matter ofwar and do not disobey the leader who is in charge of you (in order that ye may be thankful) in order thatyou are thankful for his help and blessing.
3|124|(And when thou didst say unto the believers) on the Day of Uhud: (Is it not sufficient for you) regardingyour enemy (that your Lord should support) that your Lord should help you (you with three thousand angelssent down?) from heaven to help you.
3|125|(Nay) it is sufficient to you, (but if you persevere) in war with your Prophet, (and keep from evil) and keepfrom contravening and disobeying Him, (and) the people of Mecca (attack you suddenly) from the directionof Mecca, (your Lord will help you) against your enemy (with five thousand angels sweeping on) 5,000marked angels; it is also said this means: 5,000 angels wearing turbans of wool.
3|126|(Allah ordained this) Allah mentioned this help (only as a message of good cheer for you) that you shalltriumph, (and that thereby your hearts might be at rest. Victory) by means of the help of angels (comethonly from Allah, the Mighty) in His vengeance against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) in givingtriumph and sovereignty to whomever He will; it is also said (the Wise) means: the Wise in that which befellyou on the Day of Uhud.
3|127|(That He may cut off a part) He says: if He sends His help, it is only in order to kill a group (of those whodisbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca, (or overwhelm them) defeat them (so that they retire, frustrated) nothaving gained the upper hand or booty.
3|128|(It is no concern at all of thee (Muhammad)) repentance and punishment are not in your hands wherebyyou pray against those who were defeated on the Day of Uhud, the archers and others (whether He relenttowards them) He says: if Allah chooses to relent towards them and forgive them (or punish them) becauseof their leaving their positions; (for they are evil-doers) for leaving their positions. It is also said that thiswas revealed about two tribes, the 'Asabah and Dhakwan, against whom the Prophet (pbuh) prayed whenthey killed some of his Companions.
3|129|(Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings. (Heforgiveth whom He will) whoever deserves to be forgiven, (and punisheth whom He will) whoever deservesto be punished. (Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent, (Merciful) towards him who dies in a state ofrepentance.
3|130|(O ye who believe!) i.e. Thaqif. (Devour not usury, doubling) the silver coin (and quadrupling) the appointedperiod for repayment. (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding the consumption of usury, (that yemay be successful) so that you be saved from Allah's wrath and punishment.
3|131|(And ward off (from yourselves) the Fire) fear the Fire regarding the consumption of usury which was(prepared) created (for disbelievers) in Allah and in the prohibition of usury.
3|132|(And obey Allah and the messenger) concerning the prohibition of usury and its avoidance, (that ye may findmercy) in order that mercy encompasses you such that you are saved and not punished.
3|133|(And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord) hasten to repent of usury and from alltransgressions and reach for forgiveness from your Lord, (and for a Paradise) by means of righteous worksand avoidance of usury (as wide as are the heavens and the earth) if they were to be joined to each other,(prepared) created (for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies, and theconsumption of usury;
3|134|And then He showed who they were, saying: (Those who spend (of that which Allah hath given them) inease and in adversity) He says: those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is times of comfort and intimes of hardship, (those who control their wrath) those who check their anger, keeping their hot-temperedness to themselves (and are forgiving towards mankind) towards slaves; (Allah loveth the good)He loves those who are kind towards slaves and freemen.
3|135|The following was then revealed about a man from the Helpers because he stared at, touched and kissedthe wife of a man from Thaqif, saying: (And those who, when they do an evil thing) a transgression (orwrong themselves) by staring at [women], touching or kissing (remember Allah) fear Allah (and imploreforgiveness for their sins) repent of their sins (-who forgiveth sins save Allah only?) the sins of he whorepents (-and will not knowingly) i.e. knowing that it is a transgression against Allah (repeat (the wrong)they did).
3|136|(The reward of such will be forgiveness) of their sins (from their Lord, and Gardens beneath) beneath itstrees and habitations (which rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein they will abide for ever)in Paradise, never to die or leave it, (a bountiful reward for workers!) the reward of those who repent isParadise and all that which was mentioned.
3|137|(Systems) with reward and forgiveness for those who repent and punishment and destruction for those whodo not repent (have passed away before you) have passed in bygone nations. (Do but travel in the land andsee) and reflect upon (the nature of the consequence) how the ultimate end was (for those who did deny)the messengers and did not repent of their disbelief.
3|138|(This is a declaration for mankind) this Qur'an shows for mankind what is lawful and unlawful, (a guidance)from error (and an admonition) a counsel and proscription (unto those who ward off (evil)) ward offdisbelief, idolatry and indecencies.
3|139|Allah then comforted them about that which befell them on the Day of Uhud, saying: (Faint not) do notweaken in front of your enemies (nor grieve) about that which you missed of booty on the Day of Uhud, forAllah will reward you in the Hereafter, just as you should not grieve about the killings and wounds inflictedon you, (for ye will overcome them) the ultimate result will be yours through triumph and domination (if yeare (indeed) believers) that triumph and domination is from Allah.
3|140|(If ye have received a blow) if you were harmed on the Day of Uhud, (the (disbelieving) people) the peopleof Mecca (have received) on the Day of Badr (a blow) harm (the like thereof) like the harm you received onthe Day of Uhud: (These are (only) the vicissitudes) the days of the life of this world (which We cause tofollow one another for mankind) sometimes the believers have the upper hand over the unbelievers andsometimes it is the unbelievers who have the upper hand over the believers, (to the end that Allah mayknow) that He may see (those who believe) at the time of jihad (and may choose witnesses from amongyou) He honours whom He wills among you with martyrdom; (and Allah loveth not wrong-doers) He lovesnot the idolaters, their religion or their domination.
3|141|(And that Allah may prove) may forgive (those who believe) for that which befalls them in jihad, (and mayblight the disbelievers) and may destroy the unbelievers in war.
3|142|(Or deemed ye) do you think, O group of believers (that you would enter Paradise) without fighting (whileyet Allah knoweth not) has not seen (those of you who really strive) in the way of Allah on the Day of Uhud,(nor knoweth those (of you) who are steadfast?) has not see those who are steadfast in the fight againsttheir enemies on the Day of Uhud.
3|143|(And verily ye used to wish for death) in war (before ye met it (in the field)) on the Day of Uhud. (Now yehave seen it) you have seen fighting and war on the Day of Uhud, (with your eyes!) you saw the swords ofthe unbelievers, ran away from them and did not remain unshaken with your Prophet!
3|144|When they said to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh): "O Prophet of Allah! We heard that you were killed, this iswhy we ran from the enemy," Allah revealed the following: (Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers(the like of whom) have passed away before him) before him other messengers have passed away. (Will itbe that, when he) Muhammad (dieth or is slain) in the way of Allah, (you will turn back on your heels?) youwill return to your old religion. (He who turneth back) returns to his old religion (does no hurt to Allah) suchreturn will not harm Allah, (and Allah will reward the thankful) He will reward the believers for their faith andjihad.
3|145|(No soul can ever die except by Allah's leave) except by Allah's will and decree (and at a term appointed) aman's lifespan and sustenance are both registered at an appointed term, and none shall take place before itsdue time. (Whoso desireth) with his works and jihad (the reward of the world) the benefit of this worldly life,(We bestow on him thereof) We shall give him from this worldly life what he desires but he does not haveany share in the Hereafter; (and whoso desireth) with his works and jihad (the reward of the Hereafter) thebenefit of the Hereafter, (We bestow on him thereof) We shall give him of the Hereafter what he desires.(We shall reward the thankful) reward the believers for their faith and jihad.
3|146|(And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men who fought (beside him)) againstscores of unbelievers. (They quailed not) the believers did not weaken (for aught that befell them in the wayof Allah) in terms of death and injury; it is also said that this means: how many prophets were killedalongside scores of believers, but the believers did not weaken due to that which befell them in the way ofAllah-the killing of their prophets-in obedience of Allah, (nor did they weaken) they did not lack strength tofight their enemies, (nor were they brought low) they did not abase themselves before their enemy; it is alsosaid that this means: they did not surrender to their enemy. (Allah loveth the steadfast) in fighting theirenemy alongside their Prophet.
3|147|(Their cry) the cry of the believers after the killing of their prophet (was only that they said: Our Lord) O ourLord! (Forgive us for our sins) sins other than the enormities (and wasted efforts) by committing grave sins,i.e. enormities, (make our foothold sure) in war, (and give us victory over the disbelieving folk).
3|148|(So Allah gave them the reward of the world) conquest and booty (and the good reward of the Hereafter)Paradise. (Allah loveth those whose deeds are good) Allah loves believers in the act of jihad.
3|149|(O ye who believe) meaning: Hudhayfa [Ibn al-Yaman] and 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir]! (If ye obey those whodisbelieve) i.e. Ka'b [Ibn al-Ashraf] and his followers, (they will make you turn back on your heels) they willmake you return to your old religion: disbelief, (and ye turn back as losers) duped for loosing both thisworldly life and the Hereafter and also for receiving Allah's punishment.
3|150|(But Allah is your Protector) He preserves you and will make you triumphant against them, (and He is thebest of helpers) He is the strongest of helpers.
3|151|Allah then mentioned the defeat of the unbelievers on the Day of Uhud, saying: (We shall cast terror) fear ofyou such that they run from you (into the hearts of those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca (becausethey ascribe unto Allah partners, for which no warrant hath been revealed) either in a Scripture nor taughtby a messenger. (Their habitation) their dwelling-place (is the Fire, and hapless the abode of the wrong-doers) the dwelling-place of the unbelievers is the Fire.
3|152|Allah then mentions His promise to the believers on the Day of Uhud, saying: (Allah verily made good Hispromise unto you) on the Day of Uhud (when ye routed them) when you killed them at the beginning of thefight (by His leave) by His command and help, (until (the moment) when your courage failed you) to fightagainst the enemy, (and ye disagreed about the order) you disagreed about the question of war (and yedisobeyed) the Prophet by leaving your positions, (after He had shown you that for which ye long) victoryand booty. (Some of you) some of the archers (desired the world) with their jihad and fighting. This refersto those who abandoned their positions and rushed to gather the booty, (and some of you desired theHereafter) with their jihad and fighting. This refers to 'Abdullah Ibn Jubayr and his fellow believers whoremained at their positions until they were killed. (Therefore He made you flee from them) defeated andmade them triumph over you, (that He might try you) that He might test you with the archers' disobedience.(Yet now He hath forgiven you) He did not exterminate you. (Allah is a Lord of Kindness to believers) in thatHe did not exterminate them, i.e. the archers.
3|153|Then Allah mentioned how they turned their back on the Prophet (pbuh) because of their fear of the enemy,saying: (When ye climbed) the hill after being defeated (and paid no heed to anyone) paid no heed to theProphet and did not wait for him, (while the messenger) Muhammad, (in your rear, was calling you (tofight)) he was behind you, O group of believers, saying: I am Allah's Messenger, stop and fight! (ThereforeHe rewarded you grief for (his) grief) in addition to the grief wrought upon you by Khalid Ibn al-Walid, Healso inflicted on you the grief of death and defeat, (that (He might teach) you not to sorrow either for thatwhich ye missed) of booty (or for that which befell you) and that you do not sorrow for that which befell youof deaths and injuries. (Allah is Informed of what ye do) in jihad as well as in defeat.
3|154|Allah then mentioned His blessings upon them, saying: (Then, after grief, He sent down security for you)from the enemy. (As slumber did it overcome a party of you) such that those among you who had sincerityand certitude slept, (while (the other) party, who were anxious on their own account) who were overcomewith anxiousness about themselves. This refers to Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr, the hypocrite, and his fellows whowere not overcome by sleep, (thought wrongly of Allah) that He would not come to the help of HisMessenger and his Companions, (the thought of ignorance) as they did think of Him in the time of ignorance[before the advent of Islam]. (They said: Have we any part in the cause) any part in triumph anddomination? (Say) O Muhammad: (The cause) triumph and domination (belongeth wholly to Allah) they arein the Hand of Allah. (They hide within themselves (a thought) which they reveal not unto you) for fear thatthey would be killed, (saying: Had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say) tothe hypocrites, O Muhammad: (Even though ye had been in your houses) in Medina, (those appointed to beslain would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie) where they were to be killed at Uhud. ((Allthis has been) in order that Allah might try) test (what is in your breasts) what is in the breast of thehypocrites (and prove) bring to the fore (what is in your hearts) of hypocrisy. (Allah is Aware of what ishidden in the breasts (of men)) He knows what is in people's hearts of good and evil, i.e. the hearts ofhypocrites; it is also said that it refers to the hearts of the archers.
3|155|Allah then mentioned those who fled on the Day of Uhud, saying (Lo! those of you who turned back)defeated, meaning: 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and his fellow believers (on the day when the two hosts) the hostsof Muhammad and Abu Sufyan (met, Satan alone it was who caused them to backslide) Satan enticed themto believe that Muhammad was killed and thus fled to a place about six parasangs (farasikh) from the scene.They were six people in all, (because of some of that which they have earned) because of leaving theirpositions. (Now Allah hath forgiven them) since He did not exterminate them. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) ofthose who repented among them. (Clement) for He did not hasten their punishment.
3|156|Then Allah said to the Companions of Muhammad: (O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (Benot) in war (as those who disbelieved) in secret, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers who returned toMedina (and said of their brethren) the hypocrites (who went abroad in the land) who journeyed with theCompanions of Muhammad (or were fighting in the field) or went with their Prophet in a fighting expedition:(If they had been (here) with us) in Medina (they would not have died) on their journey (or been killed)during the fighting expedition; (that Allah may make it) make that doubt (anguish) grief (in their hearts.Allah giveth life) on the journey (and causeth death) settlement; (and Allah is Seer of what ye do) of whatyou say.
3|157|(And what though ye be slain in Allah's way) O group of hypocrites (or die therein?) in your own homeswhile being sincere. (Surely pardon from Allah) of your sins (and mercy) by being spared punishment (arebetter than all that they amass) in this world of wealth.
3|158|(What though ye be slain) on a journey or in settlement (or die) in a fighting expedition, (when unto Allahyou are gathered?) after you die.
3|159|(It was by the mercy of Allah that thou wert lenient with them (O Muhammad), for if thou hadst been stern)harsh in speech (and fierce of heart) coarse with them (they would have dispersed from round about thee.So pardon them) pardon your Companions for that which may ensue from them (and ask forgiveness forthem) from that transgression which ensues from them (and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs)in matter of war. (And when thou art resolved) to do something, (then put your trust in Allah) to give youtriumph and domination. (Lo! Allah loveth those who put their trust) in Him.
3|160|(If Allah is your helper) as on the Day of Badr (none can overcome you) none of your enemy shall overcomeyou, (and if He withdraw His help from you) as on the Day of Uhud, (who is there who can help you) He willmake that no one overcomes your enemy? (In Allah let believers put their trust) the believers should puttheir trust in Allah that He will give them triumph and domination.
3|161|Then Allah mentioned their surmise about the Prophet (pbuh) that he was not going to divide any of thebooty among them, and because of this they left their positions, saying: (It is not for any Prophet) it is notpermissible for any prophet (to deceive) to cheat his community regarding booty; it is also possible that themeaning is: it is not permissible for a community to deceive its prophet. (Whoso deceiveth) as regards anyof the booty (will bring his deceit with him) carried on his neck (on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soulwill be paid in full what it hath earned) that which it has deceived and also other things; (and they will notbe wronged) their good works will not be diminished and their evil deeds will not be increased.
3|162|(Is one who followth the pleasure of Allah) in taking the fifth and shunning deceit (as one who hath earnedcondemnation from Allah) as one who deserves Allah's wrath due to his deception, (whose habitation) i.e.the dwelling of the deceiver (is the Fire, a hapless journey's end?) where he shall end up.
3|163|(There are degrees (of grace and reprobation) with Allah) He says: those who leave deceit have differentranks with Allah in Paradise; but those who deceive will occupy different levels in hell, (and Allah is Seer ofwhat ye do) whether it is deception or other things.
3|164|Allah then mentions his blessings on them, saying: (Allah verily hath shown grace to the believers bysending unto them a messenger) of the Children of Adam whose lineage is well known (of their own) anArab, like them, from the tribe of the Quraysh (who reciteth unto them His revelations) the Qur'ancontaining commands and prohibitions, (and causeth them to grow) he purifies them by means of theattestation of Allah's divine Oneness from idolatry as well as by cleansing them from their sins, (andteacheth them the Scripture) the Qur'an (and wisdom) the lawful and the prohibited; (although before) theadvent of Muhammad and the Qur'an (they were in flagrant error) they were adherents of disbelief.
3|165|He then mentioned their misfortune on the Day of Uhud, saying: (And was it so, when a disaster smote you)on the Day of Uhud, (though you had smitten (them with a disaster) twice (as great)) as you inflicted on thepeople of Mecca, on the Day of Badr, a disaster twice that inflicted on you on the Day of Uhud, (that yesaid: How is this?) how can this befall us when we are Muslims. (Say) O Muhammad: (It is from yourselves)it is due to the transgression you committed yourselves when you left your positions. (Lo! Allah is Able to doall things) whether it is punishment or something else.
3|166|(That which befell you) of deaths and injuries, (on the day when the two armies) the army of Muhammadand that of Abu Sufyan (met, was by permission of Allah) by His will and decree; (that He might know thetrue believers) that He might see the believers in jihad;
3|167|(And that He might know the hypocrites) and that He might see the hypocrites, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and hisfollowers, returning to Medina, (unto whom it was said) 'Abdullah Ibn Jubayr said to them: (Come) to Uhudand (fight in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves) and your wives and children against the enemy, orincrease the number of believers. (They answered: If we knew) there was (aught of fighting we wouldfollow you) to Uhud. (On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith) or the believers; it is also said thatthis means: their return to disbelief and the disbelievers was closer than their return to faith and thebelievers. (They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts) to corroborate it. (Allah is bestaware of what they hide) of disbelief and hypocrisy.
3|168|They are (Those who, while they sat at home) and refrained from jihad, (said of their brethren) thehypocrites in Medina: (If they) i.e. Muhammad and his Companions by remaining in Medina (had beenguided by us they would not have been slain) in their military expedition. (Say) O Muhammad, to thehypocrites: (Then avert death from yourselves if ye are truthful) in your claim.
3|169|(Think not) consider not (of those, who are slain in the way of Allah) on the Day of Badr and Uhud, (asdead) like any other dead people. (Nay, they are living) they are like the living. (With their Lord they haveprovision) they are given gifts.
3|170|(Jubilant (are they) because of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty) of His honouring,(rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind:) rejoicing because theirbrothers who are still in this world will join them because they have been given the good news that they will(that there shall no fear come upon them) when others are struck with fear (neither shall they grieve) whenothers grieve.
3|171|(They rejoice because of favour from Allah) because of a reward from Allah (and kindness) and honour, (andthat Allah wasteth not) thwarts not (the wage of the believers) regarding jihad, i.e. that which befalls themin the course of jihad.
3|172|Allah then mentioned their accompaniment of the Prophet (pbuh) in the lesser Badr (Badr al-Sughra),saying: (As for those who heard the call of Allah) answered Allah by obeying Him (and His messenger) byaccompanying him in the lesser Badr (after the harm) on the Day of Uhud (befell them (in the fight); forsuch of them as do right) by accompanying the Prophet (pbuh) at the lesser Badr (and ward off (evil)) wardoff contravention against Allah and disobeying the Messenger, (there is great reward) abundant reward inParadise,
3|173|It was also revealed about them: (Those unto whom men said) said to Nu'aym Ibn Mas'ud al-Ashja'i: (Lo!the people) Abu Sufyan and his men (have gathered against you) at the Lutaymah, the latter being a marketnear Mecca, (therefore fear them) fear going out to fight them. (But) this only (increased the faith of them)emboldened them even more (and they cried: Allah is sufficient for us!) Allah is sufficient to give victory.(Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust!) our trust is in Allah.
3|174|(So they returned with grace) reward (and favour from Allah,) and profit from that which they traded in themarket place; it is also said that this means: booty (and no harm) fighting or defeat (touched them) in goingand returning. (They followed the good pleasure of Allah) by accompanying the Prophet (pbuh) at the lesserBadr, (and Allah) by driving the enemy from them (is of Infinite Bounty) favour.
3|175|(It is only the devil) the one who was scaring you with ways of the devil, i.e. Nu'aym Ibn Mas'ud. Allah calledhim a devil because he was a follower of Satan and his whisperings (who would make (men) fear hispartisans) He says: he makes you fear his partisans: the unbelievers. (Fear them not) in your sortie; (fearMe) if you stay back, (if you are true believers) if you believe in His bringing back the dead to life.
3|176|Then Allah mentioned how the hypocrites hastened to ally themselves with the Jews, saying: (Let not theirconduct grieve thee) O Muhammad, or sadden you, (who run easily) who hasten (to disbelief) the hasteningof the hypocrites to ally themselves with the Jews, (for Lo! they injure Allah not at all) they will not harmAllah by hastening to join the Jews as allies. (It is Allah's will) Allah wants (to assign them) i.e. the Jews andhypocrites (no portion) no share (in the Hereafter) in Paradise, (and theirs will be an awful doom) as awfulas can be.
3|177|(Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith) those who preferred disbelief to faith: the hypocrites(harm Allah not at all) they do not harm Allah by choosing disbelief, (but theirs will be a painful doom)whose agony will spread to their hearts.
3|178|Allah then mentioned how He gives them respite despite their indulgence in disbelief, saying: (And let notthose who disbelieve) the Jews (imagine that the rein We give them) that the respite, progeny and wealthWe give them (bodeth good unto their souls. We only give them rein) wealth and progeny (that they maygrow in sinfulness) sinfulness in this world, later to be thrown into the dungeons of hell in the Hereafter.(And theirs will be a shameful doom) by means of which they shall be shamed day after day and hour afterhour; it is also said that this means: a severe doom; and it is also said that from (Let not their conductgrieve you) to (And theirs will be a shameful doom) was revealed about the idolaters of Mecca on the Day ofUhud.
3|179|With regard to the idolaters saying to Muhammad: "You say to us that there are amongst us believers andunbelievers. Show us, O Muhammad, who believes among us and who does not", Allah then said: (It is not(the purpose) of Allah to leave the believers) and unbelievers (in your present state) of religion until thebeliever becomes an unbeliever and the unbeliever becomes a believer if it is so in His decree (till He shallseparate the wicked from the good) the damned from the felicitous, the unbeliever from the believer and thehypocrite from the sincere. (And it is not (the purpose of) Allah to let you know) O people of Mecca (theunseen) such that you know who believes and who does not. (But Allah chooseth) selects (of Hismessengers whom He will) i.e. Muhammad, and informs him of some of the unseen through revelation. (Sobelieve in Allah and His messengers) believe in all the messengers and Scriptures. (If ye believe) in Allah andall the Scriptures and messengers (and ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief and idolatry, (yours will be a vastreward) an abundant reward in Paradise.
3|180|Allah then mentioned the miserliness of the Jews and hypocrites in relation to that which Allah hath giventhem, saying: (And let not those who hoard up that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty) interms of wealth (think that it is better for them. Nay, it is worse for them. That which they hoard) of wealth,i.e. gold and silver (will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection) will be used as a collar of fire around theirnecks. (Allah's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth) the stores of the heavens and earth, i.e. rainand vegetation, are Allah's; it is also said that this means: the dwellers of the heavens and earth will die anddominion shall be for Allah, the One, the Conqueror, (and Allah is Informed of what ye do) of acts ofgenerosity or miserliness.
3|181|Then Allah mentioned the Jews, Finhas Ibn 'Azura' and his friends when they said: "O Muhammad! Allah ispoor: He is asking us to give Him a loan", saying (Verily Allah heard the saying of those) Finhas Ibn 'Azura'and his fellows (who said, (when asked for contributions to the war): "Allah, forsooth, is poor) He needs usto give Him a loan, (and we are rich!") and we do not need a loan from Him. (We shall record their saying)We shall preserve for them what they have said in the Hereafter (with their slaying of the Prophets) just asWe shall record for them their slaying of the prophets (wrongfully) without them having committed anycrime (and We shall say: Taste ye the punishment of burning!) which is very severe.
3|182|(This) punishment (is on account of that which your own hands have sent before you) which your handshave earned. (Allah is no oppressor of (His) bondmen) such that He punishes them without them havingcommitted a crime.
3|183|((The same are) those) i.e. the Jews (who say: Lo! Allah hath charged us) Allah has commanded us in theScripture (that we believe not in any messenger) we will not accept that anyone is sent with a message(until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour) that is until Allah sends a fire which willdevour this offering, as it happened in the time of the [Jewish] prophets. (Say) O Muhammad: (Messengerscame unto you before me with miracles) with commands and prohibitions as well as signs, (and with that(very miracle) which ye describe) of an offering [devoured by fire], Zachariah, John and Jesus. (Why thendid ye slay them?) why did you kill John and Zachariah, when such an offering [devoured by fire] took placeduring their time. ((Answer that) if ye are truthful) in your claim.
3|184|When they replied that their fathers never killed any prophet wrongfully, Allah said: (And if they deny thee)O Muhammad regarding what you say to them, do not be saddened, (even so did they deny messengerswho were before you) their people denied them, (who came with miracles) with commands and prohibitionsand signs of prophethood (and with the Psalms) and with the news relating to the Scriptures of past nations(and with the Scripture giving light) showing the lawful and the prohibited.
3|185|Allah then mentioned their deaths and what happens after their deaths, saying: (Every soul) that breathes(will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned) thereward of your works. (Whoso is removed from the Fire) by means of declaring Allah's divine Oneness anddoing righteous works (and is made to enter Paradise, he indeed is triumphant) in that he gains Paradiseand that which it contains, and is further saved from hell and that which it contains. (The life of this world isbut comfort of illusion) which is comparable to the relative duration of the stuff one has at home such aspottery, bottles, and the like.
3|186|Allah then mentioned the harm that the unbelievers inflicted on the Prophet and his Companions, saying:(Assuredly ye will be tried) you will be tested (in your property) by the loss of your property (and in yourpersons) and in what befalls your persons of sicknesses, pain, killings, beatings and general misfortunes,(and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you) i.e. the Jews andChristians: you will hear vilification, defamation, lies and false testimony against Allah, (and from theidolaters) i.e. the Arab idolaters. (But if ye persevere) in the face of their harm (and ward off (evil)) andward off transgressing against Allah while facing such harm, (then that) steadfastness and endurance (is ofthe steadfast heart of things) is the best of things and the most firm for believers.
3|187|Then Allah mentioned His covenant with the people of the Book in the Scripture, which required them toexposit the traits and description of His Prophet, saying: (And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on thosewho had received the Scripture) i.e. the Torah and the Gospel ((He said): Ye are to expound it) the trait anddescription of Muhammad (to mankind and not to hide it) not to hide these traits and description ofMuhammad in their Scripture. (But they flung it behind their backs) and did not act upon it (and boughtthereby a little gain) a paltry acquisition in their means of living by hiding the traits and description ofMuhammad in their Scripture. (Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby) evil is that which theyhave chosen for themselves: Judaism and the concealment of the traits and description of Muhammad.
3|188|Allah then mentioned their longing for praise and credit for that which they-the Jews-did not have, saying:(Think not) suppose not, O Muhammad (that those who exult in what they have given) whereby theychanged the traits and description of Muhammad in their Scripture, (and love to be praised for what theyhave not done) they like that people say they have good in them when they do not. They like that peoplesay that they are follower of the Religion of Abraham and that they are good to the poor. (Think not) OMuhammad, (they are in safety from the doom. A painful doom is theirs) a severe torment shall be theirs.
3|189|(Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth) to Allah belong the stores of theheavens (rain) and the earth (vegetation). (Allah is Able to do all things) in relation to the dwellers of theheavens and the earth and to their stores.
3|190|Allah then exposited on the sign of His ability to the unbelievers of Mecca when they said: "O Muhammad,bring us a clear sign to prove what you are saying", saying: (Lo! In the creation of the heavens) in thatwhich We created in the heavens of angels, the sun, moon, stars and clouds (and the earth) and in thecreation of the earth and what is in it of mountains, seas, trees and beasts (and (in) the difference of nightand day) and in the alternation of day and night (are tokens (of His sovereignty)) signs of His divineOneness (for men of understanding) for those among them who have reasons,
3|191|(Such as remember Allah) pray to Allah, (standing) when they are able to, (sitting) when they cannot stand,(and reclining) when they can neither stand nor sit, (and consider) the marvellous things which arecontained in (the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say): Our Lord) they say: O our Lord! (Thoucreatedst not this in vain) for nothing. (Glory be to Thee!) exalt Allah [from any thought that He createdthem in vain]. (Preserve us from the doom of Fire) drive away from us the torment of hell.
3|192|(Our Lord) they say: O our Lord! (Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast confounded)You have humiliated. (For evil-doers) for the idolaters (there will be no helpers) none will prevent what isgoing to happen to them in the Hereafter.
3|193|(Our Lord!) they say: O our Lord. (Lo! we have heard a crier) they mean Muhammad (calling unto Faith)calling to Allah's divine Oneness: ("Believe ye in your Lord!" So we believed) in You, in Your Scripture as wellas in Your Messenger. (Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins) our enormities, (and remit from us) overlook(our evil deeds) other than enormities, (and make us die the death of the righteous) take our souls to You ina state of faith and gather them with the souls of the prophets and the righteous.
3|194|(Our Lord!) and they say: O our Lord. (And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thymessengers) on the tongue of Your Messenger, i.e. Muhammad. (Confound us not) torment us not (uponthe Day of Resurrection) as You will torment the unbelievers. (Lo! Thou breakest not the tryst) resurrectionafter death and that which You have promised the believers.
3|195|(And their Lord hath heard them) and answered their request ((and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work ofany worker, male or female, to be lost) I thwart not the actions of any one of you. (Ye proceed one fromanother) if some of you follow the religion of others or are allies to them. Allah then exposited the honourHe bestowed upon the Emigrants (al-Muhajirun), saying: (So those who fled) from Mecca to Medina with theProphet (pbuh) and after the Prophet (and were driven forth from their homes) the Meccan unbelieversdrove them from their homes in Mecca (and suffered damage for My cause) for My obedience, (and fought)the enemy in the way of Allah (and were slain) until they were killed, (verily I shall remit their evil deedsfrom them) which were committed in the course of jihad (and verily I shall bring them into Gardens beneathwhich) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk (flow. A reward fromAllah) a recompense for them from Allah. (And with Allah is the fairest of rewards) a good return which isbetter than their reward.
3|196|Allah then reminded them of the evanescence of this world and of the continuity of the Hereafter, andencouraged them to seek the latter, saying: (Let not the vicissitude (of the success) of those who disbelievein the land) the coming and going of the Jews for trade, (deceive thee) O Muhammad! Although Muhammadis here the addressee, this is directed at his Companions.
3|197|(It is but a brief comfort) it is but a paltry benefit in the life of this world. (And afterward their habitation willbe hell, an ill abode) an ill spread and end result.
3|198|(But those who keep their duty to their Lord) Allah says: and those who believe in the divine Oneness oftheir Lord by repenting from disbelief, (for them are Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees andhabitations (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein they will be safe for ever) they dwelltherein for eternity, never to die or to leave it. (A gift of welcome) a reward (from their Lord. That whichAllah hath in store) in terms of reward (is better for the righteous) for those who declare Allah's divineOneness than that which He has given the unbelievers in the life of this world.
3|199|Allah then described those from the people of the Book who had believed-'Abdullah Ibn Salam and hisfollowers-saying: (And Lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah and that whichis revealed unto you) the Qur'an (and that which was revealed unto them) of Scripture: the Torah,(humbling themselves before Allah) humble and meek vis-�-vis Allah in worship. (They purchase not atrifling gain) a paltry recompense of means of living (at the price of the revelations of Allah) by hiding thetraits and description of Muhammad in the Scripture. (Verily their reward) their recompense (is with theirLord) in Paradise, (and Lo! Allah is swift to take account) when He takes people into account, He is veryswift.
3|200|Allah then encouraged them to be steadfast in jihad and misfortunes, saying: (O ye who believe!) inMuhammad and the Qur'an. (Endure) in jihad along with your Prophet, (outdo all others in endurance)overwhelm and overcome your enemy, (be ready) along with your Prophet for your enemy as long as theystand in wait to attack you; it is also said that this means: (Endure) the performance of the obligations andthe avoidance of transgressions, (outdo all others in endurance) overwhelm and overcome the partisans ofdeviant beliefs and blameworthy innovations, (be ready) with your horses for the sake of Allah, (and observeyour duty to Allah) obey Allah in that which He has commanded you, such that you never abstain from it, (inorder that ye may succeed) in order that you be saved from Allah's wrath and punishment'.
4|1|And on his authority from Ibn 'Abbas on Allah's saying: (O mankind!) [he said:] 'This is an expression ofgeneral applicability, but it could also be of particular applicability. (Be careful of your duty to your Lord)obey your Lord (Who created you) by means of copulation (from a single soul) from the soul of Adam alone,for the soul of Eve was included in his (and from it) from the soul of Adam (created its mate) Eve (and fromthem twain has spread abroad) He created through the copulation of Adam and Eve (a multitude of menand women) scores of human beings: male and female. (Be careful of your duty towards Allah) obey Allah(in Whom ye claim (your rights) of one another) your stuff and rights by Allah's right, (and towards thewombs (that bare you)) and also by the right of kinship and filiation; or it could also mean: keep the ties ofkinship and do not sever them. (Lo! Allah hath been a Watcher over you) He has been a Protector: He shallask you about that which He has commanded you of acts of obedience and keeping ties of kinship.
4|2|(Give unto orphans their wealth) which is with you when they reach the legal age. (Exchange not the goodfor the bad (in your management)) do not consume their wealth which is prohibited for you while leavingyour own wealth which is lawful for you (nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth) by mixing them. (Lo!That) wrongfully consuming the wealth of the orphan (would be a great sin) which will be met by Allah'spunishment. This was revealed about a man from Ghatafan who had in his possession a great amount ofwealth that belonged to his orphaned nephew. When this verse was revealed he decided to separate thewealth of his nephew from his own for fear of committing a sin. Allah then revealed the following:
4|3|(And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans) and if you fear that you will not preserve orphans'wealth, you should also fear not dealing fairly with women in relation to providing sustenance andapportionment. This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten.Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them frommarrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that whichAllah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry morethan four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment andproviding sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess)of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe anywaiting period. (Thus it) marrying just one woman (is more likely that ye will not do injustice) that you willnot incline to some at the expense of others or that you transgress regarding the provision of sustenanceand apportionment to four wives.
4|4|(And give unto the women, (whom ye marry) free gift) as an obligation from Allah upon you (of theirmarriage portions) their dowries; (but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof) if they makelawful for you to take some of the dowry, (then ye are welcome to absorb it (in your wealth)) there is noblame or sin on you if you do so. Before Islam, men used to marry without giving any dowry to their wives.
4|5|(Give not unto the foolish) do not give to those who are ignorant of the rights of women and children (yourwealth which Allah hath given you to maintain) as a means of living; (but feed and clothe them from it) beyourselves responsible for feeding and clothing them, for you know better than them the right thing to doconcerning sustenance and alms giving, (and speak kindly unto them) if you do not have anything to givethem, promise them that you will clothe them and give to them.
4|6|(Prove orphans) test the intelligence of orphans (till they reach the marriageable age) the age of puberty;(then, if ye find them of) if you see that they possess (sound judgement) righteousness in Religion and atendency to protect their wealth, (deliver over unto them their fortune) then give their wealth which is withyou; (and devour it not squandering) it in transgression and unlawfully (and in haste) in haste lest theorphan grows older and consumes it little by little (lest they should grow up) for fear that they grow olderand stop you from devouring their wealth. (Whoso (of the guardians) is rich) and needs not the orphan'swealth, (let him abstain generously) because of his richness from taking of the property of orphans, norshould he diminish anything from their wealth; (and whoso is poor) and needy (let him take thereof inreason (for his guardianship)) in measure, such that he is not in need for the wealth of orphans; it is alsosaid that this means: he should take from the wealth of orphans in proportion with the measure of his workregarding this wealth; and it is also said that this means: he can take from the wealth of orphans as a loanto be paid back. (And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans) when they reach the legal age, (have(the transaction) witnessed in their presence) when you deliver it to them. (Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner)Allah suffices as a witness. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Rifa'ah al-Ansari.
4|7|Allah then mentioned the share of men and women in inheritance-because they were not in the habit ofgiving any inheritance to women and children-saying: (Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of thatwhich parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindredleave, whether it is a little or much) whether the inheritance is much or little (a legal share) a determinedshare whether it is much or little, but He did not specify these shares. Allah did expound consequently onthe exact value of these shares. This verse was revealed about Umm Kuhhah and her daughters who had anuncle who did not give them anything from their inheritance.
4|8|(And when kinsfolk) who are not entitled to receive a share of the inheritance (and orphans) the orphans ofbelievers before the division of the inheritance (and the needy) the needy among believers (are present atthe division) of the heritage, (bestow on them there from) give them something of the inheritance beforeyou proceed to divide it upon those who are entitled to receive it (and speak kindly unto them) if theinheritor has not yet reached the age of puberty, by promising them to speak to the inheritor about givingthem something.
4|9|(And let those) who visit a sick person and enjoin him to bequeath more than a third of his inheritance (fear(in their behaviour toward orphans)) the ruin of the children of this sick person after he dies (who if they leftbehind them) after they die (weak offspring) unable to fend for themselves (would be afraid for them) toface ruin. Just as they would fear ruin for their own children, they ought to fear ruin for the children of anydeceased person; it is also said that this means: enjoin the person who is on his deathbed that which youwould enjoin yourself; and fear for the loss of his children if he were to die, as you would fear for the loss ofyour own children if you were to die. This is because they were in the habit of visiting people who were ontheir deathbeds and enjoining them to give their property to this and that person until nothing was left fortheir own children, so Allah prohibited them from so doing. Then Allah said: (So let them mind their duty toAllah) let them fear Allah regarding the bequeathing of more than a third of the inheritance to those who arenot entitled to inheritance, (and speak) to the person who is sick [expecting to die] (justly) about his will.
4|10|(Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully) extortionately, (they do but swallow fire into theirbellies) i.e. that which is unlawful; it is also said that this means: Allah will place fire in their bellies on theDay of Judgement (and they will be exposed to burning flame) a blazing fire in the Hereafter. This verse wasrevealed about Hanzalah Ibn Shamardal.
4|11|Allah then exposited the share of the male and female in inheritance, saying: (Allah chargeth you) Allahexpounds to you (concerning your children) concerning the inheritance of your children after you die: (to themale the equivalent of the portion of two females) the share of two females, (and if there be women) blooddaughters (more than two) two or more daughters, (then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if therebe one) daughter ((only) then the half) of the inheritance. (And to his parents a sixth of the inheritance, ifhe) the deceased person (have a son) or daughter; (and if he) the deceased person (have no son) ordaughter (and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the third) and the reminder is theshare of the father; (and if he) the deceased person (have brethren) full brothers or half brothers fromeither the father or the mother, (then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any legacy he may havebequeathed, or debt (hath been paid)) after paying the debt of the deceased and extracting any bequestwhich does not exceed a third of the inheritance. (Your parents or your children: Ye know not) in this world(which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness) in the Hereafter in terms of rank; it is also said that thismeans: you do not know which of them is nearer in usefulness in this world with regard to inheritance. (It isan injunction from Allah) upon you that you divide the estates. (Lo! Allah is Knower) in relation to thedivision of inheritance, (Wise) in relation to the difference between the shares of the male and female.
4|12|(And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave) of property, (if they have no child) male orfemale, from you or from other than you; (but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that whichthey leave) of property, (after any legacy they may have bequeathed, or debt) after paying back any debtthat they may have contracted and extracting any bequest she may have bequeathed. (And unto thembelongeth the fourth of that which ye leave) of property (if ye have no child) male or female from them orfrom other than them, (but if ye have a child) male or female, from them or from other than them (then theeighth of that which ye leave) of property, (after any legacy ye may have bequeathed, or debt (ye may havecontracted, hath been paid)) after paying back any debt you may have contracted and extracting anybequest you may have bequeathed to someone. (And if a man) who does not have parents, children orkinsfolk related to his parents or children (or a woman) who is in the same situation (have a distant heir(having left neither parent nor child)) brothers or sisters from the mother side. It is also said that this refersto any kin other than parents and children, (and he (or she)) the deceased (have a brother or a sister) onlyon the mother's side (then to each of them twain (the brother and the sister) the sixth, and if they be morethan two, then they shall be sharers in the third) the male and the female having equal share, (after anylegacy that may have been bequeathed or debt (contracted)) after paying back any debt that the deceasedmay have contracted and after extracting any bequest that he may have bequeathed provided it does notexceed a third of the inheritance (not injuring) the heirs by willing away more than a third of the inheritance(hath been paid. A commandment from Allah) it is an obligation upon you from Allah that you must divideinheritance. (Allah is Knower) regarding the division of inheritance, (Indulgent) in relation to that whichhappens between you of ignorance and deception regarding the division of inheritance, despite of which Hedoes not hasten His punishment upon you.
4|13|(These are the limits (imposed by) Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations imposed by Allah.(Whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger) regarding the division of estates, (He will make him enterGardens beneath which) beneath its habitations and trees (rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk(flow, where such will dwell for ever) dwelling forever in Paradise, never to die or leave it. (That will be thegreat success) the greatest salvation through entering Paradise.
4|14|(And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger) regarding the division of estates (and transgresseth Hislimits) contravenes His legal rulings and obligations through deviation and disobedience, (He will make himenter Fire, where such will dwell for ever) continually abiding in the Fire until whenever Allah wills; (his willbe a shameful doom) through which he will be humiliated; it is also said that (be a shameful doom) means:a severe torment.
4|15|(As for those of your women) your free, married women (who are guilty of lewdness) i.e. of fornication, (callto witness) that they were caught red-handed in the act (four of you against them) four of your free men.(And if they testify) to the Truth of the allegation (then confine them to the houses) keep them in prison(until death take them) until they die in prison (or (until) Allah appoint for them a way) out by means ofstoning. Imprisoning a free, married woman who commits fornication until she dies in prison was laterabrogated by stoning.
4|16|(And as for the two of you) of your free people, i.e. any unmarried man or woman (who are guilty thereof)who are guilty of adultery, (punish them both) by maligning and upbraiding them. (And if they repent) afterthis (and improve) in relation to that which is between them and Allah, (then let them be) refrain frommaligning and upbraiding them. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) He overlooks sins, (Merciful). Maligning andupbraiding the unmarried person who commits adultery was later abrogated and replaced by one hundredlashes for both parties.
4|17|(Allah accepteth the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance) even if they do so purposefully whilebeing ignorant of its respective punishment ((and) then turn quickly (in repentance) to Allah) before beingled away for punishment or at the moment of suffering from the pangs of death. (These are they towardswhom Allah relenteth) Allah overlooks the sins of these. (Allah is ever Knower) of your repentance, (Wise)by accepting your repentance before death, while does not accept it when one is suffering from the pangs ofdeath or after one dies.
4|18|(The forgiveness) Allah overlooking sins (is not for those who do ill deeds until, when death attendeth uponone of them) when one of them is suffering from the agony of death, (he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yetfor those who die while they are disbelievers). Allah says that He does not accept the repentance ofunbelievers at the moment they suffer the pangs of death. (For such) for the unbelievers (We have prepareda painful doom) this was revealed about Tu'mah and his companions who had left Islam.
4|19|(O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you forcibly) coercively (to inherit the women (of your deceasedkinsmen)) the women of your fathers, (nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them) by preventing themfrom marrying again. This verse was revealed about Kabshah Bint Ma'an al-Ansariyyah and Muhsin Ibn AbiQays al-Ansari; for before the advent of Islam, they used to inherit the women of their fathers (that ye maytake away a part of that which ye have given them) take away part of that which your fathers gave them,(unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness) unless they are guilty of fornication by the testimony ofwitnesses in which case they should be imprisoned. However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by theverse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same wayas they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. Ifthe woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If,however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave her untoucheduntil she ransomed herself with her own money. Allah forbade them from indulging in such a practice. ThenHe showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (inkindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen thatye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteouschildren from them.
4|20|(And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another) He says: If you wish to marry a woman and divorce oneyou are already married to, or marry a woman in addition to the one you are already married to (and yehave given unto one of them a sum of money (however great)) a dowry, (take nothing from it) from thedowry. (Would ye take it) the dowry (by the way of calumny) as an unlawful possession (and open wrong?)a clear transgression.
4|21|(How can ye take it (back)) how can you take the dowry back as a lawful possession. (after one of you hathgone in unto the other) when you have come together under one cover as a result of this dowry andmarriage, (and they have taken) He says: Allah has taken from you upon marrying women (a strong pledgefrom you?) a firm pledge that you either keep them in goodness or release them in kindness. Then Allahforbade them from marrying the wives of their fathers, since this is what they did in the pre-Islamic era.
4|22|He said: (And marry not those women whom your fathers married, except what hath already happened (ofthat nature) in the past) in the pre-Islamic era. (Lo! It) i.e. marrying the wives of one's father (was everlewdness) a transgression (and abomination) antagonism, (and an evil way) the worst way to follow. Thiswas revealed about Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari. Allah then showed them the women who are unlawful forthem to marry.
4|23|He said: (Forbidden unto you are your mothers) your blood mothers, (and your daughters) your blooddaughters, (and your sisters) your blood sisters, whether from both parents or from either one of them, (andyour father's sisters, and your mother's sisters, and your brother's daughters) the daughters of your bloodbrother whether he is a full brother or half brother from the father or the mother (and your sister'sdaughters) and the daughters of your sister whether she is a full sister or half sister from the father ormother, (and your foster mothers) who suckled you within the first two years, (and your foster sisters, andyour mothers-in-law) whether you have consummated the marriage with their daughters or not: in bothcases you are forbidden from marrying them, (and your stepdaughters who are under your protection) whoare brought up in your homes ((born) of your women unto whom ye have gone in) with whom you aremarried and consummated this marriage (but if ye have not gone in unto them) if you have not haveconsummated the marriage with their mothers, (then it is no sin for you) to marry their daughters after youdivorce their mothers (and the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins) your sons who areborn in wedlock. (And (it is forbidden unto you) that ye should have two sisters together) whether they arefree or slave sisters, (except what hath already happened (of that nature) in the past) before Islam. (Lo!Allah is ever Forgiving) of that which ensued from you in the pre-Islamic era, (Merciful) regarding that whichensues from you in Islam, provided that you repent.
4|24|(And all married women (are forbidden unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess) ofcaptives, even if they have husbands in the Abode of War, after ascertaining that they are not pregnant, bywaiting for the lapse of one period of menstruation. (It is a decree of Allah for you) that which I havementioned to you is unlawful in Allah's Book. (Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned) as unlawful,(so that ye seek them) marry (with your wealth) up to four wives; it is also said that this means: so that youbuy with your wealth captives; and it is also said that this means: so that you should seek with your moneymarrying women for an agreed period of time (zawaj al-mut'ah) but the lawfulness of this practice was laterabrogated, (in honest wedlock) He says: be with them as legitimate husbands, (not debauchery) notindulging in adultery without having a proper marriage. (And those of whom) after marriage (ye seekcontent) from whom you derive benefit, (give unto them their portions) give to them their full dowry (as aduty) as an obligation upon you from Allah to give the dowry in full. (And there is no sin for you) there is noharm for you (in what ye do by mutual agreement) in increasing or decreasing the amount of the dowry bymutual agreement (after the duty hath been done) after the first obligation to which you have aspired. (Lo!Allah is ever Knower) in relation to making lawful to you marriage for an agreed, limited period of time,(Wise) in later making this practice unlawful; it is also said that this means: Allah is ever Knower of yourcompulsion for marriage for an agreed, limited period of time, Wise in making such marriage unlawful.
4|25|(And whoso is not able to afford to marry free, believing women, let them marry from the believing maidswhom your right hands possess) who are in the hands of the believers. (Allah knoweth best (concerning)your faith) He knows best that your hearts are firm in faith. (Ye (proceed) one from another) You are all thechildren of Adam; it is also said that this means: some of you follow the religion of others; and it is also saidthat this means: you are strengthened by one another; (so wed them) marry the maids (by permission oftheir folk) their owners, (and give unto them) the maids (their portions) their dowry (in kindness) on top ofthe price given to the prostitute for providing sex, (they being honest) He says: marry those maids who arechaste, (not debauched) not those who commit adultery in the open (nor of loose conduct) nor those whohave lovers who commit adultery with them in secret. (And if when they are honourably married) if whenthey marry maids (they commit lewdness) fornication (they) the maids (shall incur the half of thepunishment (prescribed)) lashing (for free women (in that case). This is) marrying maids is lawful (for himamong you who feareth to commit sin) adultery and debauchery. (But to have patience) and refrain frommarrying maids (would be better for you) in that your children would be free. (Allah is Forgiving) of theadultery you might commit, (Merciful) when He gave you a legal dispensation to marry captives in cases ofnecessity.
4|26|(Allah wishes to explain to you) that which is lawful for you; it is also said that this means: Allah wouldexplain to you that having patience and refraining from marrying captives is better for you than marryingthem (and guide you) expound to you (by the examples of those who were before you) among the people ofthe Book who were forbidden from marrying captives, (and would turn to you in mercy) He will forgive youthat which ensued from you in pre-Islamic times. (Allah is Knower) that you have a dire need for marriage,(Wise) when He prohibited you to marry them except upon necessity.
4|27|(And Allah wishes to turn to you in mercy) He wishes to overlook your transgression when He made adulteryand marrying your sisters, from the father's side, forbidden for you; (but those who follow vain desires) i.e.adultery and marrying their sisters from their fathers' side, namely, the Jews (would have you gotremendously astray) commit a serious error by marrying your sisters, from the father's side, by claimingthat it is lawful in their Scripture.
4|28|(Allah would make the burden light for you) He wishes to make things easy for you by marrying captives incase of necessity, (for man was created weak) in that he cannot do without women.
4|29|(O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity) through transgression,usurpation, false testimony, lying in oath or through other unlawful means, (except it be a trade by mutualconsent) except if there is mutual agreement between you in the course of buying and selling or in abatingthe price in selling (Muhabat), (and kill not one another) without justified right. (Lo! Allah is ever Mercifulunto you) when He forbade you to kill one another without such a justification.
4|30|(Whoso doeth that) killing another or wrongfully taking another person's property (through aggression andinjustice, We shall cast him into Fire) in the Hereafter; this is a threat to such a person, (and that) castinghim into the Fire and tormenting him (is ever easy for Allah).

4|32|(And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others) Allah says: a man should notcovet the wealth, mount or wife of his brother nor, in fact, anything that his brother may possess. Ratheryou should ask of Allah abundant bounty and say: "O Allah provide us with the like of, or better than, whatyou have provided him with", while consigning the matter to Allah. It is also said that this verse wasrevealed about Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (pbuh) because she said to him: "if only it isprescribed unto us as it is prescribed unto men so that we get rewarded as men do". Allah prohibited suchtalk, saying: covet not the thing in which Allah has made a group of you excel over others, such as prayingin congregation, attending the Friday Prayer, participating in military expeditions, jihad, enjoining good andforbidding evil. In this verse (some of you) and (others) refers to men and women. Allah then explained thereward that men and women earn for their works, saying: (Unto men a fortune) a reward (from that whichthey have earned) of works of goodness, (and unto women a fortune) a reward (from that which they haveearned) of works of goodness in their homes. (But ask Allah of His bounty) Ask Allah to give you successand protection. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower of all things) good and bad, reward and punishment, success andotherwise.
4|33|(And unto each) He says: to each one of you (We have appointed heirs) so that they inherit (of that whichparents and near kindred leave) of property; (and as for those with whom your right hands have made acovenant) your stipulation, (give them their due) give them their stipulation. But this is now abrogated. Inthe pre-Islamic era, they used to adopt men and youth and allocate for them a portion of their wealth, justas they would do with their own children. Allah abrogated such a practice. However, it is not abrogated if hegives them their portion from a third of his wealth. (Lo! Allah is ever witness over) Allah knows (all things)relating to your works.
4|34|(Men are in charge of women) they are in charge of overseeing the proper conduct of women, (becauseAllah hath made the one of them) the men through reason and the division of booty and estates (to excelthe other) the women, (and because they spend of their property (for the support of women)) throughpaying the dowry and spending on them, which the women are not required to do. (So good women) Hesays: those wives who are kind to their husbands (are the obedient) they are obedient to Allah regardingtheir husbands, (guarding) their own persons and the wealth of their husbands (in secret) when theirhusbands are not present (that which Allah hath guarded) through Allah's protection of them in that He gavethem the success to do so. (As for those from whom ye fear) know (rebellion) their disobedience to you inbed, (admonish them) by means of sacred knowledge and the Qur'an (and banish them to beds apart) turnyour faces away from them in bed, (and scourge them) in a mild, unexaggerated manner. (Then if theyobey you) in bed, (seek not a way against them) as regards love. (Lo! Allah is ever High Exalted) aboveevery single thing, (Great) greater than every single thing. Allah has not burdened you with that which youcannot bear, so do not burden women with that which they cannot bear of affection.
4|35|(And if ye fear) if you know (a breech between them twain (the man and wife)) a dispute between the manand woman and you cannot establish who is at fault, (appoint an arbiter from his folk) from the man's folkto the man so that he can hear what he has to say and therefore establish whether he is in the right orwrong (and an arbiter from her folk) from the woman's folk to the woman in order to hear what she has tosay and therefore establish whether she is in the right or wrong. (If they) the arbiters (desire amendment)between the man and the woman, (Allah will make them of one mind) i.e. the arbiters, the man and thewoman. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) of the agreement and disagreement of the arbiters, (Aware) of the doingof the woman and the man. The verses from Allah's saying: (Men are in charge of women, because Allahhath made the one of them to excel the other...) to His saying: (If they desire amendment Allah will makethem of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware) were revealed about the daughter of Muhammad IbnSalamah. Her husband, As'ad Ibn al-Rabi' had slapped her because she refused to sleep with him.Consequently, she went to the Prophet (pbuh) to seek retaliation against her husband, but Allah prohibitedher from doing so.

Allah commands kindness towards her (and the wayfarer) Allah commands thehonouring of guests. Honouring a guest for three days is the guest's right. The honour bestowed on theguest after the third day is considered a charity on the part of the host; (and (the slaves) whom your righthands possess) Allah commands kindness towards slaves, males and females. (Lo! Allah loveth not such asare proud) in their walking (and boastful) about the bounties of Allah, showing nothing but wantonness andarrogance towards Allah's servants,

4|41|(But how (will it be with them)) how shall the unbelievers react (when we bring of every people a witness) aprophet who will testify that he has delivered the message to them, (and We bring thee) O Muhammad (awitness against these?) it is also said that this means: We bring you, O Muhammad, a witness in favour ofyour Community, testifying that it is reliable and upright. This is because his Community will be a witness forthe other prophets against their nations when the latter will deny having received any message from them.
4|42|(On that day) on the Day of Resurrection (those who disbelieved) in Allah (and disobeyed the messenger) bydenying his message (will wish that they were level with the ground) they will wish that they become dustwith the beasts, (and they can hide no fact from Allah) they will not say: O Allah, our Lord! We did notassociate any partner with you.
4|43|Allah revealed the following about the Companions of Muhammad prior to the prohibition of intoxicants: (Oye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (Draw not near unto prayer) in the Mosque of the Prophet(pbuh) with the Prophet (pbuh) (when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter) so that you knowwhat the prayer leader recites during the prayer, (nor when ye are polluted) nor when you are in a state ofmajor ritual impurity, (save when journeying upon the road) except when passing through when you haveto, (till ye have bathed) to purify yourselves from major ritual impurity. (And if ye be ill) wounded, (or on ajourney, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women) made love to them, (and ye findnot water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces) with the first clap (and your hands (therewith))with the second clap. (Lo! Allah is Benign) Allah is Generous for the abundance He has given you,(Forgiving) of any shortcoming that may ensue from you.
4|44|(Seest thou not) have you not been informed in the Scripture about (those unto whom a portion of theScripture hath been given) those who were given knowledge of the Torah, (how they purchase error?) theychoose Judaism, (and seek to make you (Muslims) err from the right way) i.e. abandon Islam. This wasrevealed about al-Yasa' and Rafi' the sons of Harmalah, two Jewish Rabbis, who invited 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayyand his friends to embrace their religion.
4|45|(Allah knoweth best (who are) your enemies) from among the hypocrites and the Jews. (Allah is sufficient asa Friend) as a Protector, (and Allah is sufficient as a Helper) as a Defender against them.
4|46|(Some of those who are Jews) Malik Ibn al-Sayf and his friends (change words from their context) theychange the traits and description of Muhammad after these were exposited upon in the Torah, and thencome to Muhammad (and say: "We hear) your words, O Muhammad (and disobey) your command, when heis not around them; and we (hear thou) O Muhammad (as one who heareth not" and "Listen to us!"distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: "We hear) your saying, O Muhammad(and we obey) your command; (hear you) hear from us, (and look at us" it had been better for them) thantheir insults and defamation, (and more upright) and more correct. (But Allah hath cursed them) punishesthem by making them pay the capitation tax (for their disbelief) as a punishment for their disbelief, (so theybelieve not, save a few) among them who have accepted Islam such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his friends.
4|47|(O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given!) O you to whom knowledge of the traits and description ofMuhammad in the Torah has been given. (Believe in what We have revealed) the Qur'an (concerning thatwhich) confirms what (ye possess) in terms of Allah's divine Oneness and the traits and description ofMuhammad (pbuh) (before We destroy countenances) before We change your hearts (so as to confoundthem) so as to turn them away from the lights of guidance and transform their faces to the back of theirheads, (or curse them) turn them into animals (as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers (of old time)) by turningthem into apes. (And the commandment of Allah is always executed) after the revelation of this verse'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions embraced Islam.
4|48|(Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him) if one dies in such a state. He forgiveth(all) save that to whom He will) to whomever repents. (Whoso ascribeth partners to Allah, he hath indeedinvented a tremendous sin) a tremendous lie. This verse was revealed about Wahshiyy, the murderer ofHamzah, the uncle of the Prophet (pbuh).
4|49|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed in the Scripture about (those who praise themselves forpurity?) those who absolve themselves from transgression. The reference here is to Buhayr Ibn 'Amr andMarhab Ibn Zayd. (Nay, Allah purifieth) absolves from sins (whom He will) whoever is fit for it, (and they willnot be wronged even the hair upon a date stone) their sins will not be diminished even by the hair upon adate stone.
4|50|(See) O Muhammad, (how they invent lies about Allah!) by saying: the sins that we commit during the daywill be forgiven at night, and the sins we commit during the night will be forgiven in the day. (That of itselfis flagrant sin) a clear lie about Allah.
4|51|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, about (those unto whom a portion of theScripture has been given) those who have been given knowledge of the Torah in relation to your trait andattribute, the verse of stoning [married people who commit fornication], and similar other issue, namely.Malik Ibn al-Sayf and his friends who were about seventy people, (how they believe in idols) this is HuyayyIbn Akhtab (and false deities) Ka'b Ibn Ashraf, (and bow they say of those (idolaters) who disbelieve) theunbelievers of Mecca: ("These are more rightly guided) they have a better religion (than those whobelieve?") in the Qur'an and in Muhammad and his Religion.
4|52|(Those are they whom Allah hath cursed) Allah has punished them by imposing on them the capitation tax,(and he whom Allah hath cursed) he whom Allah punishes in this world or in the Hereafter, (thou) OMuhammad (wilt find for him no helper) to save him from Allah's punishment.
4|53|(Or have they even a share) if the Jews had a share (in the Sovereignty? Then in that case, they would notgive mankind) they would not give Muhammad and his Companions (even the speck on a date stone).
4|54|(Or are they jealous) nay, they are jealous (of mankind) of Muhammad and his Companions (because of thatwhich Allah of His bounty hath bestowed upon them?) the Scripture, prophethood and marrying many wives.(For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham) David and Solomon ((of old) the Scripture and Wisdom)knowledge, understanding and prophethood, (and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom) We honouredthem with prophethood and Islam and bestowed upon them sovereignty over the Children of Israel. Davidhad 100 legitimate wives, and Solomon had 300 legitimate wives plus 700 concubines.
4|55|(And of them) of the Jews (were (some) who believed therein) believed in the Scripture of David andSolomon (and of them were (some) who disbelieved therein. Hell is sufficient for (their) burning) i.e. Ka'band his followers.
4|56|(Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations) Muhammad and the Qur'an, (We shall expose them to the Fire)in the Hereafter. This is a threat to them. (As often as their skins are consumed) by the Fire (We shallexchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment) so that they feel the torment. (Lo! Allah isever Mighty) by taking vengeance on them, (Wise) He ruled that burnt skins be exchanged for fresh ones.
4|57|Then Allah said about the believers: (And as for those who believe) in Muhammad, the Qur'an and in allScriptures and messengers (and do good works) acts of obedience, i.e. they sincerely perform that which isbetween them and their Lord, (We shall make them enter) in the Hereafter (Gardens beneath which)beneath its trees and walls (rivers) rivers of wine, milk, honey and water (flow to dwell therein for ever)dwelling in Paradise, never to die or be removed; (there for them) in Paradise (are pure companions) theyare pure from menstruation and filth (and We shall make them enter plenteous shade) a protected retreat;and it is also said that this means: an extended shade.
4|58|Regarding the key that the Prophet (pbuh) took from 'Uthman Ibn Talhah as a deposit, Allah commandedHis Messenger to give back deposits to their owner, saying: (Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye restoredeposits) to give back the key (to their owners) to 'Uthman Ibn Talhah, (and, if ye judge between mankind)between 'Uthman Ibn Talhah and 'Abbas Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, (that you judge justly) that you give back to'Uthman and the providing of water (siqaya) to al-'Abbas. (Lo! comely is this which Allah admonisheth you)comely is this which Allah commands you, of giving back deposits to their owners and judging justly. (Lo!Allah is ever Hearer) when al-'Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah! give me both the key and the providing ofwater, (Seer) of what 'Uthman Ibn Talhah did when he refused to give the key and said: By Allah's trust!Give me my right, O Messenger of Allah!
4|59|(O ye who believe!) 'Uthman Ibn Talhah and his fellow believers. (Obey Allah) in that which He hascommanded you, (and obey the messenger) in that which he commands you (and those of you who are inauthority) the leaders of military expeditions; it also said that this means: the men of sacred knowledge;(and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to Allah) to the Book of Allah (and the messenger)and to the practice of the Messenger (if you are (in truth) believers in Allah and the Last Day) resurrectionafter death. (That) referring the matter to the Book of Allah and the practice of His Messenger (is better andmore seemly in the end).
4|60|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, about (those who pretend that theybelieve in that which is revealed unto thee) i.e. the Qur'an (and that which was revealed before thee) i.e.the Torah, (how they would go for judgement (in their disputes) to false deities) Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf (whenthey have been ordered) in the Qur'an (to abjure them?) to disavow them. (Satan would mislead them farastray) from the Truth and guidance. This verse was revealed about a hypocrite by the name of Bishr whom'Umar Ibn al-Khattab had killed. This hypocrite had a dispute with a Jewish man.
4|61|(And then it is said unto them) to Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah, the hypocrite, who had a dispute with al-ZubayrIbn al-'Awwam, the cousin of the Prophet (pbuh): (Come unto that which Allah hath revealed) come to theruling which Allah has revealed in the Qur'an (and unto the messenger) and to the judgement of themessenger, (thou seest the hypocrites) Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah (turn from you with aversion) turn away fromyour judgement in complete rejection.
4|62|(How would it be) what shall they do (if a misfortune) a punishment (smote them because of that whichtheir own hands have sent before (them)) because of turning away (they come unto you) after that,(swearing by Allah) i.e. Hatib swearing by Allah (that they were seeking naught) when they turned away(but harmony) in speech (and kindness) correctness.
4|63|(Those are they) i.e. him who did turn away from the Prophet (pbuh) (the secrets of whose hearts Allahknoweth) He knows the hypocrisy in the heart of Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah. Another interpretation of the aboveverse is: How shall they do-those who established a counter mosque-when a punishment strikes them,because of the counter mosque they built, and then afterward came to you-Tha'labah and Hatib-swearing byAllah that they did not intend by the building of the mosque except kindness to the believers and religiousharmony, so that you send us a man of knowledge to teach us? Allah knows the hypocrisy and antagonismin the hearts of those who built this counter mosque. (So oppose them) leave them and do not punish themthis time (and admonish them) with your words so that they do not do it again, (and address them in plainterms about their souls) threaten them in an unequivocal way that you will punish them if they do it again.
4|64|(We sent no messenger save that he) that the messenger (should be obeyed by Allah's leave) by Allah'scommand; We do not send him so that he is opposed or has his judgement rejected by turning away fromhim. (And if, when they) those who built the counter mosque and Hatib (had wronged themselves) by sobuilding it and turning away from you, (they had but come unto thee) to repent (and asked forgiveness ofAllah) repented to Allah for their actions (and asked forgiveness of the messenger) and the Messengerprayed for them, (they would have found Allah Forgiving) He overlooks their transgressions, (Merciful) He isafter repentance.
4|65|(But nay, by your lord) Allah swore by Himself and by the age of Muhammad, (they will not believe) insecret nor deserve to be called believers when alone (until they make thee judge of what is in disputebetween them and find within themselves) in their hearts (no dislike) no doubt (of that which thou decidest)between them, (and submit with full submission) totally submit to you.
4|66|(And if We had decreed for them) as We decreed for the Children of Israel: (Lay down your lives or go forthfrom your dwellings) empty handed, (but few of them) among the sincere ones, i.e. their leader Thabit IbnQays Ibn Shammas al-Ansari (would have done it) with a good disposition of the soul; (though if they) thehypocrites (did what they are exhorted) commanded (to do) of repentance and sincerity (it would be betterfor them) in the Hereafter than the condition they are in secret, (and more strengthening) and more real inthis world;
4|67|(And then) if they did what they were commanded to do (We should bestow upon them from Our presence)from Us (an immense reward) an abundant reward in Paradise,
4|68|(And should guide them unto a straight path) and We would have made them in this world firm upon anestablished Religion that We are pleased with, i.e. Islam.
4|69|(Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger) this verse was revealed about Thawban, the client of Allah'sMessenger (pbuh) who said: "I am afraid not to meet you in the Hereafter, O Messenger of Allah!" This isbecause he loved him intensely and could not bear being away from him. Allah's Messenger saw the changein him and so Allah mentioned the honour bestowed on him, saying: whoever obeys Allah regarding theobligations and obeys the Prophet regarding the prophetic practices (they are) in Paradise (with those untowhom Allah hath shown favour, of the Prophets) Muhammad (pbuh) and the other prophets, (and thesaints) the best among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) (and the martyrs) those who were martyredin the way of Allah (and the righteous) the righteous among the Community of Muhammad (pbuh). (Thebest of company are they) in Paradise!
4|70|(Such) keeping the company of the prophets, saints, martyrs and righteous (is the bounty of Allah) a favourfrom Allah, (and Allah sufficeth as knower) of the love of Thawban and the honour and reward bestowedupon him in Paradise.
4|71|Knowing that they went out to fight in the way of Allah, Allah said: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad andthe Qur'an! (Take your precautions) against your enemy and do not advance dispersed, (then advance theproven ones) then put forward the ones that are the best, (or advance all together) with your Prophet.
4|72|(Lo! among you) O group of believers (there is he who loitereth) there is him who cannot bring himself to goout in the way of Allah-meaning 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy-but rather waits to see what happens to you on yourexpedition; (and if) on your expedition (disaster) death, defeat or hardship (overtook you, he) 'Abdullah IbnUbayy (would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me) by my staying back (since I was not present withthem) on that expedition.
4|73|(And if) on that expedition (a bounty) conquest and booty (from Allah befell you, he) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy(would surely cry, as if there had been no love between you and him:) a bond of Religion and acquaintancedue to keeping each other's company between you (Oh, would that I had been with them!) on theexpedition, (then should I have achieved a great success) I would have gained abundant booty and a greatshare.
4|74|Allah then commanded them to fight in the way of Allah, if they happened to be hypocrites, saying: (Letthose fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah (who sell the life of this world for the other) those whoprefer this world over the next; it is also said that this verse was revealed about sincere believers, tellingthem: let those who prefer the Hereafter over this world fight in the way of Allah. Then Allah mentionedtheir reward, saying: (Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, (be he slain) martyred (orbe he victorious) triumphant over the enemy, (on him We shall bestow) in both cases (a vast reward) anabundant reward in Paradise.
4|75|Allah then mentioned their dislike of fighting in the way of Allah, saying: (How should ye) O group ofbelievers (not fight for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah against the people of Mecca (and of thefeeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying) in Mecca: (Our Lord!) O our Lord!(Bring us forth from out this town) i.e. Mecca (of which the people are oppressors!) whose people areidolaters (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some protecting friend!) a protector, meaning: 'ItabIbn Usayd. (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some defender!) who would prevent us fromsuffering. Allah answered their prayers and made the Prophet (pbuh) their defender and 'Itab theirprotecting friend.
4|76|Then Allah mentioned their fighting in the way of Allah, saying: (Those who believe) Muhammad and hisCompanions (do battle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve) Abu Sufyan and his companions (dobattle for the cause of idols) in obedience of Satan. (So fight the minions of the devil) the soldiers of thedevil. (Lo! the devil's strategy) the devil's work and stratagem (is ever weak) in that he will let them down ashe did on the Day of Badr.
4|77|Allah then mentioned their dislike of joining the Prophet on the lesser Badr, saying: (Hast thou not seen)have you not been informed, O Muhammad, about (those unto whom it was said) those to whom you said inMecca, referring to 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn 'Awf al-Zuhri, Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas al-Zuhri, Qudamah Ibn Maz'unal-Jumahi, Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi and Talhah Ibn 'Abdullah al-Tamimi: (Withhold your hands) fromkilling and beating, for I have not ordered the initiation of fighting, (establish worship) establish the fivedaily prayers in full with their bowings and prostrations and that which is obligated therein of their appointedtimes (and pay the poor-due) give the poor their due from your wealth, (but when fighting) jihad in the wayof Allah (was prescribed) obligated (for them) in Medina (behold, a party of them) among them Talhah Ibn'Abdullah (fear mankind) the people of Mecca (even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear, and say: OurLord!) O our Lord! (Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us?) why have You obligated on us jihad in Yourway? (If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while!) if only You would keep us safe for a short whilebefore death. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The comfort of this world) the benefit of this world (is scant) inthe Hereafter; (the Hereafter) the reward of the Hereafter (will be better for him who wardeth off (evil))who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies; (and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date stone)their good deeds will not be diminished even if it be as much as the down on a date stone.
4|78|(Wheresoever ye may be) O sincere believers, on land or on the sea, in settlement or travelling, (death willovertake you, even though ye were in lofty towers) in fortified towers. Allah then mentioned the saying ofthe Jews and hypocrites: "since Muhammad and his Companions came to us, our harvests and fields havekept ever decreasing", saying: (Yet if a happy thing) land fertility, lower prices and continuous rainthroughout the year (befalleth them) the Jews and hypocrites (they say: This is from Allah) for He knew thatwe were good; (and if an evil thing) drought, dearth, hardship and high prices (befalleth them they say: Thisis of your doing) this is because of the ill-omen of Muhammad and his Companions. (Say (unto them)) untothe Jews and hypocrites, O Muhammad: (All) hardship and blessing (is from Allah. What is amiss with thesepeople) the Jews and hypocrites (that they come not nigh to understand a happening?) that both hardshipand bounty are from Allah.
4|79|Allah then mentioned that which brings bounty and hardship, saying: (Whatever of good) of land fertility,low prices and continuous rain throughout the year (befalleth thee) O Muhammad (it is from Allah) it is ofAllah's bounty for you. Although Allah addressed Muhammad (pbuh) here it was his people who were meantby it, (and whatever of ill) drought, dearth and high prices (befalleth thee it is from yourself) it is because ofthe purity of yourself, in that He purifies you because of it; it is also said that the above means: whatevergood befalls you, such as conquest and booty, it is from Allah, as an honour from Allah; and whatever badhappens, such as killing and defeat as was the case at Uhud, is due to the transgression of your Companionswhen they left their positions. It is also said that this means: whatever good you do is because of Allah'sgiven success and help; and whatever evil you commit is due to the transgression of your soul and Hishaving forsaken you. (We have sent thee (Muhammad) as a messenger) to convey the message (untomankind) to the jinn and human beings (and Allah is sufficient as witness) of that which they say: whatevergood befalls them is from Allah and whatever evil befalls them is due to the ill-omen of Muhammad (pbuh)and his companions. It is also said that this means: Allah is sufficient as witness for their saying: bring awitness to testify that you are a messenger from Allah.
4|80|When the verse (We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave) was revealed,'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: "Muhammad commands us to obey him instead of obeying Allah", so Allahrevealed the following: (Whoso obeyeth the messenger) in that which he commands (obeys Allah) becausethe Messenger never commands anything unless Allah has commanded it, (and whoso turneth away) fromobeying the messenger: (We have not sent thee as a warder) a custodian (over them).
4|81|(And they say) i.e. the hypocrites 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers: ((It is) obedience) your command isobeyed, O Muhammad. Command us with whatever you will and we shall comply; (but when they havegone forth from thee a party of them) of the hypocrites (spend the night in planning other than what thousayest) what you command. (Allah recordeth what they plan by night) He records their planning to changeyour command. (So oppose them) but do not punish them (and put thy trust in Allah) rely on Allahregarding that which they are good for. (Allah is sufficient as Trustee) He is sufficient to give you triumphand sovereignty over them.
4|82|(Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an?) do they not reflect on the Qur'an that its different parts areharmonious and support each other and it further contains that which the Prophet (pbuh) commands them?(If it had been from other than Allah) if this Qur'an had come from anyone other than Allah (they wouldhave found therein much incongruity) much contradictions whereby its different parts are not harmonious.
4|83|Allah then mentioned the betrayal of the hypocrites, saying: (And if any tidings whether of safety) any newsabout the army, conquest or booty, they insist on it out of resentful envy (or fear) and when they receiveany news about the army, killings or defeat, (come unto them, they noise it abroad) they divulge it,(whereas if they had referred it) the news of the army (to the messenger) until the messenger informs them(and such of them as are in authority) those possessed of reason and understanding, i.e. Abu Bakr and hiscompanions, (those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it) i.e. the precisenews. (If it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy) by means of His given success and protection(you would have followed Satan) all of you, (save a few (of you)) who would not divulge the news.
4|84|Then Allah commanded His Prophet to engage in jihad in the way of Allah and proceed to the Lesser Badr,saying: (So fight (O Muhammad) in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah. (Thou are not taxed) you are notcommanded this (except for thyself and urge on the believers) to advance with you. (Peradventure Allah)peradventure when it is used in relation to Allah means that Allah will take it upon Himself (will restrain) willstop (the might) the fighting (of those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca. (Allah is stronger in might)in His torment (and stronger in inflicting punishment).
4|85|Allah then mentioned the reward of him who believes and the punishment of him who disbelieves, referringrespectively to Abu Bakr and Abu Jahl, saying: (Whoso interveneth in a good cause) whoever helps to uniteor reconcile two parties (will have the reward thereof) a reward of that good deed, (and whoso intervenethin an evil cause) who ascribes partners to Allah or acts as a tale-bearer (will bear the consequence thereof)will bear the onus of such an evil deed. (Allah overseeth all things) He rewards good and bad deeds; it isalso said that this means: He oversees the sustenance of everyone: those who do good works as well asthose who do evil.
4|86|(When ye are greeted with a greeting) when someone greets you with a greeting, (greet ye with a betterthan it) this is for those of your Religion and belief by adding to the formula of greeting (or return it) orreturn the exact greeting, if the one who greets you happens to be of another religion. (Lo! Allah takethcount of all things) of greeting and the return of greetings, just as He is a witness and will reward all. Thisverse was revealed about a group of people who refrained from returning greetings.
4|87|Allah then declared His divine Oneness, saying: (Allah! There is no God save Him. He gathers you all unto aDay of Resurrection) on the Day of Judgement (whereof there is no doubt. Who is more true in statement)in words (than Allah?).
4|88|The following was revealed about ten hypocrites who left Islam and Medina for Mecca: (What aileth you) Ogroup of believers (that you are become two parties) one party of the view that the hypocrites' wealth andblood are lawful and a party holding the opposite view (regarding the hypocrites) who abandoned Islam,(when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned) because of their hypocrisy and evilintentions? (Seek you to guide) to the religion of Allah (him whom Allah hath sent astray) from His religion?(He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him thou (O Muhammad) canst not find a road) youcannot find a religion or argument in their favour.
4|89|(They long that you should disbelieve) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (even as they disbelieve, that ye maybe upon a level (with them)) in following idolatry. (So choose not friends from them) in religion or forseeking assistance and backing (till they forsake their homes) until they believe again and migrate (in theway of Allah) in obedience of Allah; (if they turn back) from faith and migration (then take them) asprisoners (and kill them wherever you find them) in the Sacred Precinct or anywhere else, (and choose nofriend) in religion or for seeking assistance and backing (nor helper) a protector (from among them),
4|90|Allah then made an exception, saying: (Except those) among the ten men who fled to Mecca (who seekrefuge with a people) i.e. the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir al-Aslami (between whom and you there is acovenant) a pact and peace, (or (those who)) the people of Hilal (come unto you because their hearts forbidthem to make war) they come to you because they are annoyed at the huge cost they have to pay due tothis pact (on you or make war on their own folk) due to their ties of kinship. (Had Allah willed He could havegiven them power over you) i.e. the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir (so that assuredly they would have foughtyou) together with their people upon the conquest of Mecca. (So, if they hold aloof from you and wage notwar against you) upon the conquest of Mecca (and offer you peace) they submit to you through peace andhonouring the pact they made, (Allah alloweth you no way against them) He does not give you any excusefor killing them.
4|91|(You will find others) other than the people of Hilal, Asad and Ghatafan for example (who desire that theyshould have security from you) they desire that their persons and wealth and families be safe from you bythe declaration of "there is no god but Allah", (and security from their own folk) and desire to be safe fromtheir clan by adhering to disbelief. (So often as they are returned to hostility) to idolatry (they are plungedtherein) they revert to it. (If they keep not aloof from you) upon the conquest of Mecca (nor offer youpeace) nor submit to you by means of a treaty (nor hold their hands) from fighting you upon the conquestof Mecca, (then take them) as prisoners (and kill them wherever you find them) in the Sacred Precinct oranywhere else. (Against such) i.e. Asad and Ghatafan (We have given you clear warrant) to kill them.
4|92|(It is not for a believer) it is not allowed for a believer, meaning here 'Ayyash Ibn Abi Rabi'ah (to kill abeliever) Harith Ibn Zayd ((unless (it be) by mistake) even if it be by mistake. (He who hath killed a believerby mistake must set free a believing slave) a slave who believes in Allah and His Messenger, (and pay theblood money) in full (to the family of the slain) to the next of kin of the victim who have the right to demandretaliation, (unless they remit it as a charity) unless the next of kin of the victim remit the blood money tothe killer as a charity. (If he) the victim (be of a people hostile unto you) who are at war with you, (and he)i.e. the victim (is a believer, then (the penance is) to set free a believing slave) the killer should set free aslave who believes in Allah and His Messenger and so does not have to pay the blood money. Harithbelonged to a people who were at war with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). (And if he) the victim (cometh ofa folk between whom and you there is a covenant) a treaty and peace, (then the blood money must bepaid) in full (unto his folk) to the next of kin of the victim (and (also) a believing slave must be set free) aslave who believes in the divine Oneness of Allah. (And whoso hath not the wherewithal) to set free abelieving slave (must fast two consecutive months) continuously. (A penance from Allah) if he does this,Allah will forgive him for killing a believer by mistake. (Allah is Knower) of him who kills by mistake, (Wise)in that which he ought to do.
4|93|Then Allah revealed about Miqyas Ibn Sababah, the killer of al-Fihri, the emissary of Allah's Messenger(pbuh) who, after taking the blood money for the killing of his brother Hisham Ibn Sababah, left Islam andfled to Mecca, saying: (Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell) for this wilful killing (forever) due to his idolatry. (Allah is wroth against him) for taking the blood money (and He hath cursed him)because he killed a person who did not kill his brother (and prepared for him an awful doom) because of hisboldness towards Allah.
4|94|Then Allah revealed about Usamah Ibn Zayd who killed Mirdas Ibn Nuhayk al-Farari, a fellow believer,saying: (O ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah) in jihad, (be careful todiscriminate) between who is a believer and who is an unbeliever, (and say not unto one who offereth youpeace) he who greets you and says to you "there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger ofAllah": ("Thou art not a believer";) and then kill him (seeking the chance profits of this life) so that you maydespoil him. (With Allah are plenteous spoils) He has with Him a tremendous reward for him who avoidskilling a fellow believer. (Even thus (as he now is) were ye before) with your people feeling safe with thebelievers and with Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions because of the attestation of "there is no god butAllah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah", before the Emigration; (but Allah hath since then beengracious unto you) by migrating from the unbelievers. (Therefore take care to discriminate) such that you donot kill believers. (Allah is ever informed of what ye do) whether it is killing someone or other things.
4|95|Allah then explained the reward of those who fight in the way of Allah, saying: (Those of the believers whosit still) although they do not suffer from any disabling hurt, and do not participate in jihad, (other thanthose who have a (disabling) hurt) if they were to participate in jihad, i.e. either they are weak in theirbodies or have lost their sight, as with 'Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum and 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh al-Asdi, (are noton an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth) by spending their money (andlives. Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank) a merit (above thesedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt. (Unto each) those who engage in jihad and those who donot (Allah hath promised good) Paradise due to their faith, (but He hath bestowed on those who strive)those who engage in jihad in his way (a great reward) an abundant reward in Paradise (above thesedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt;
4|96|(Degrees of rank from Him) merits from Allah in bestowing different ranks, (and forgiveness) of sins (andmercy) that saves one from torment. (Allah is ever Forgiving) of those who repent of staying back and whogoes out on jihad, (Merciful) towards him who dies in a state of repentance.
4|97|Then, Allah revealed the following about the 50 people who had left Islam and were all killed during theBattle of Badr, saying: (Lo! as for those whom the angels take (in death)) at the Battle of Badr (while theywrong themselves) by being idolaters, ((the angels) will ask) upon taking their souls: (In what were youengaged) what were you doing in Mecca? (They will say: We were oppressed) and humiliated (in the land)in Mecca at the hands of the unbelievers. ((The angels) will say: Was not Allah's earth) Medina (spacious)safe (that ye could have migrated therein? As for such) group of people, (their habitation) their dwelling (willbe hell, an evil journey's end) they will come to;
4|98|Allah then showed who had an excuse, saying: (Except the feeble among men) the elderly and the weak,(and the women, and the children, who are unable to devise a plan) for leaving Mecca (and are not shown away) they do not know how to leave.
4|99|(As for such, it may be) it is a requisite (that Allah will pardon them) that which ensues from them. (Allah isever Clement) towards the likes of these, (Forgiving) of those who repent amongst them.
4|100|(Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah (will find much refuge) and a sanctuary (andabundance) of means of living and safety (in the earth) in Medina. This was revealed about Aktham IbnSayfi and again about Jundu' Ibn Damura, an old man who lived in Mecca and who migrated from the latterto Medina but died in al-Tan'im. His reward is the same as the reward of those who made it to Mecca, andso he died with his endeavour highly praised. Allah said in this context: (and whoso forsaketh his home) inMecca, (a fugitive unto Allah) unto the obedience of Allah (and His messenger) and unto His Messenger inMedina, (and death overtaketh him) at al-Tan'im, (his reward) the reward of his migration (is thenincumbent on Allah. Allah is ever Forgiving) of his past idolatry, (Merciful) regarding that which ensued fromhim in Islam.
4|101|(And when ye go forth in the land) when you travel, (it is no sin for you to curtail (your) worship) curtail theprayer that a sedentary Muslim would usually perform (if ye fear) if you know (that those who disbelievemay attack you) may kill you while in prayer. (In truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you) this iswhat is called the prayer of fear (salat al-khawf).
4|102|Allah said: (And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them) present with them (and arranges (their)worship for them) and stand to lead the prayer for them, begin by saying Allah is the greatest (Allahu akbar)and let them repeat the same after you, (let only a party of them stand with thee) in prayer (and let themtake their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations) when they have prayed one unit (letthem fall) let them retreat (to the rear) to the position of their fellow believers who are facing the enemy(and let another party) who were facing the enemy (come that hath not worshipped) that has not performedthe first unit of prayer with you (and let them worship with thee) let them pray with you the second unit ofprayer, (and let them take their precaution) against the enemy (and their arms) let them take their armswith them. (Those who disbelieve) i.e. the Banu Anmar (long for you to neglect your arms) and be obliviousto them (and your baggage) and they also long that you forget the means of war (that they may attack youonce for all) while you are performing the prayers. Then Allah gave the believers a legal dispensation to putdown their arms, saying: (It is no sin for you) there is no harm for you (to lay aside your arms, if rain)intense rain (impedeth you or ye are sick) wounded. (But take your precaution) against your enemy. (Lo!Allah prepareth for the disbelievers) the Banu Anmar (shameful punishment) by means of which they will behumiliated; it is also said that this means: a severe punishment.
4|103|(When ye have performed the act of worship) when you have finished performing the prayer of fear,(remember Allah) pray to Allah, (standing) for the one who is healthy, (sitting) for the one who is sick (andreclining) for the one who is wounded or sick. (And when ye are in safety) when you return home and feelno more fear, (observe proper worship) perform the prayer in full: four units of prayer. (Worship at fixedhours hath been) performing the prayer is (enjoined on the believers) prescribed and known both while inresidence and during travel: the traveller performs two units of prayer and the resident four.
4|104|Allah then encouraged the believers to go in pursuit of Abu Sufyan and his men after the Day of Uhud,saying: (Relent not) do not slacken or weaken (in pursuit of the enemy) Abu Sufyan and his men. (If ye aresuffering) from your wounds, (lo! they suffer) from their wounds (even as ye suffer and ye hope from Allah)His reward and fear His torment (that for which they cannot hope. Allah is ever Knower) of your wounds,(Wise) He enjoined upon you to go in pursuit of these people.
4|105|Then Allah mentioned the story of Tu'mah Ibn Ubayriq who stole the armour and the Jew, Zayd Ibn Samin,who was accused of this theft, saying: (Lo! We reveal unto thee the Scripture) We have sent you Gabrielwith the Qur'an (with the Truth) to show what is true and what is false, (that thou mayst judge betweenmankind) justly: between Tu'mah and Zayd Ibn Samin (by that which Allah showeth thee) by that whichAllah hath taught and shown you in the Qur'an. (And be not thou a pleader) a helper (for the treacherous)through their theft, i.e. Tu'mah;
4|106|(And seek forgiveness of Allah) repent to Allah for being on the verge of hitting the Jew, Zayd Ibn Samin.(Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful) of him who dies repentant; it is also said that this means: Allah isForgiving of the transgression you were about to commit, Merciful towards you.
4|107|(And plead not on behalf of (people) who deceive themselves) by stealing. (Lo! Allah loveth not one who istreacherous) through stealing (and sinful) by lying in his oath and falsely accusing an innocent person.
4|108|(They seek to hide from) they are ashamed of (men and seek not to hide from Allah) but they feel no shametowards Allah. (He is with them) He is Aware of them (when by night they hold discourse displeasing untoHim) they utter that which displeases Allah and displeases people. (Allah ever surroundeth what they do)and say.
4|109|(Lo! you are) the people of Tu'mah, i.e. the Banu Zufr (they who pleaded) argue (for them) for Tu'mah (inthe life of the world. But who will plead) argue (with Allah for them) Tu'mah (on the Day of Resurrection, orwho will then be their) Tu'mah's (defender) who will bail him out from Allah's torment?
4|110|(Yet whoso doeth evil) whoever steals (or wrongeth his own soul) by lying in his oath or falsely accusing aninnocent person, (then seeketh pardon of Allah) and then repents to Allah, (will find Allah Forgiving) of hissins, (Merciful) in that He accepted his repentance.
4|111|(Whoso commiteth a sin) steals and falsely swears by Allah (commiteth it only against himself) he only earnsthe punishment of that sin. (Allah is ever Knower) of the one who stole the armour, (Wise) by commandingthat his hand be cut.
4|112|(And whoso commiteth a delinquency) a theft (or crime) and falsely swears by Allah, (then throweth (theblame)) the theft (thereof upon the innocent) Zayd Ibn Samin, (hath burdened himself) has sentencedhimself (with falsehood) the punishment of a great falsehood (and a flagrant crime) and the punishment of aflagrant sin.
4|113|(But for the grace of Allah upon thee (Muhammad)) by bestowing upon you prophethood, (and His mercy)by sending Gabriel to you, (a party of them) of the clan of Tu'mah (had resolved) wanted and was planning(to mislead thee) in issuing the right judgement, (but they will mislead only themselves) regarding thejudgement (and they will hurt thee not at all) because the hurt will befall those who committed perjury.(Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture) He has sent you Gabriel with the Qur'an (and wisdom) expositing init the lawful and the unlawful as well judicial decision (qada'), (and teacheth thee) by means of the Qur'an,legal rulings and legal punishments (that which thou knewest not) before the revelation of the Qur'an. (Thegrace of Allah towards you) by bestowing upon you prophethood (hath been infinite).
4|114|(There is no good in much of their) i.e. of the clan of Tu'mah's (secret conferences save (in) him whoenjoineth almsgiving) him who encourages the giving of alms to the poor (and kindness) giving a loan toanother person (and peace making among the people) reconciliation between Tu'mah and Zayd Ibn Samin,the Jew. (Whoso doeth that) giving alms and lending money, (seeking the good pleasure of Allah) onlyseeking Allah's contentment, (We shall bestow on him a vast reward) in Paradise.
4|115|(And whoso opposeth the messenger) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and his judgement, i.e. Tu'mah(after the guidance (of Allah) hath been manifested unto him, and followth other than the believer's way)and prefers the religion of the people of Mecca, idolatry, over the religion of the believers, (We appoint forhim that unto which he himself hath turned) We shall leave him to that which he has chosen in this world,(and expose him unto hell) in the Hereafter (a hapless journey's end) will be his ultimate consequence!
4|116|(Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto him) if one dies in this state, such as Tu'mah.(He pardoneth all save that) save the ascription of partners to Him (to whom He will) to whoever is fit for it.(Whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah hath wandered far astray) from guidance.
4|117|(They invoke in His stead) the people of Mecca worship in place of Allah (only females) lifeless idols such asal-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat; (they pray to) they worship (none else than Satan, a rebel) who is intense in hisrebellion
4|118|(Whom Allah cursed) Allah has banished him from all good, (and he) Satan (said: Surely I will take) I willovercome and make slip (of Thy bondmen an appointed portion) an appointed share, and that which Iimprint in him shall be his obligation and command; it is also said that this means: out of every thousandpeople, 999 are destined for the Fire.
4|119|(And surely I will lead them astray) far from guidance, (and surely I will arouse desires in them) such that tothem there is hell or Paradise, (and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle's ears) what isknown as the Bahirah, (and surely I will command them and they will change Allah's creation) Allah'sReligion. (Whoso chooseth Satan) whoever worships Satan (for a patron) as a Lord (instead of Allah is verilya loser) he has been cheated (and his loss is manifest) by losing this world and the Hereafter.
4|120|(He promiseth them) Satan promises them that there is no Paradise or hell (and stirreth up desires in them)he arouses hope in them that this world lasts forever, (and Satan promiseth them only to beguile) hepromises them only falsehood and lies.
4|121|(For such) for the unbelievers, (their habitation) their dwelling (will be hell, and they will find no refugetherefrom) they will find no escape or sanctuary.
4|122|(But as for those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) i.e. acts of obedience, inrelation to that which binds them to their Lord (We shall bring them into Gardens underneath which)beneath its rooms and habitations (rivers) of wine, water, milk and honey (flow, wherein they will abide)they will abide in Paradise, never to die or be removed (for ever. It is a promise from Allah) regardingParadise and hell (in truth) which shall truly happen; (and who can be more truthful than Allah in utterance)in promise?
4|123|(It will not be in accordance with your desires) it is not as you desire, O believers, that no harm shall cometo you after you have accepted the faith, (nor the desires of the People of the Scripture) nor is it as thepeople of the Book desire when they say: "whatever sins we commit during the day will be forgiven at night,and whatever sins we commit during the night will be forgiven in the day". (He who doeth wrong) evil (willhave the recompense thereof) the believers will be recompensed in this world or after death before enteringParadise, and the unbelievers in the Hereafter before entering hell, (and will not find against Allah) againstthe torment of Allah (any protecting friend) any relative to benefit him (or helper) to save him from thetorment.
4|124|(And whoso doeth good works) acts of obedience, relating to that which is between him and his Lord,(whether of male or female, and he (or she) is a believer) while being a believer who is genuine in his or herfaith, (such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a date stone) their rewards will notbe diminished even if it be by the size of the dint in a date stone.
4|125|(Who is better in religion) who is firmer in religion and better in speech (than he who surrendereth hispurpose to Allah) than him whose Religion and works are sincerely devoted to Allah (while doing good (tomen)) good in deed and speech (and follows the tradition of Abraham, the upright) who surrenderedcompletely to Allah? (Allah (Himself) chose Abraham for friend).
4|126|(Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings andmarvels: they are all his bondsmen and bondswomen. (Allah ever surroundeth) has the knowledge of (allthings) in relation to the dwellers of the heavens and the earth.

(Whatever good ye do) by being kind to them, (lo! Allah isever Aware of it) as well as of your intentions.
4|128|(If a woman) i.e. 'Umayrah (feareth) is aware of (ill treatment) i.e. refrains from having sex with her (fromher husband) As'ad Ibn al-Rabi', (or desertion) not speaking or sitting with her, (it is no sin for them twain)the man and the woman (if they make terms of peace between themselves) between the husband and wifewhereby both of them are made content. (Peace) such that the wife is pleased (is better) than transgressionand aversion. (But greed hath been made present in the minds) souls are naturally inclined to beparsimonious, such that the wife withholds the share of her husband; it is also said that this means: hergreed drives her to be pleased. (If ye do good) if you are equal in your treatment of the young wife and theelderly wife in the estates and maintenance (and keep from evil) avoid transgression and aversion, (Lo! Allahis ever Informed of what ye do) of transgression and aversion.
4|129|(Ye will not be able to deal equally between (your) wives) as regards love, (however much ye wish (to doso)) even if you exert your efforts: (But turn not altogether away) with your bodies ((from one)) in favour ofthe young wife, (leaving her) the other one: the old wife (as in suspense) like a prisoner: neither unmarriednor married. (If ye do good and keep from evil) if you treat them equally and avoid transgression andaversion, (lo! Allah is ever Forgiving) of those who repent of transgression and aversion, (Merciful) towardsthose who die in a state of repentance.
4|130|(But if they separate) i.e. the man and the woman through divorce, (Allah will compensate each) the manand the woman (out of His abundance) from His provision: the man will be compensated with another wifeand the woman with another husband. (Allah is ever All-Embracing) in relation to them as regards marriage,(All-Knowing) of that which He prescribed for them of justice.

4|136|(O ye who believe) O you who believed on the day of the covenant and disbelieved thereafter! (Believe) now(in Allah and His messenger) it is also said that Allah called them by the name of their forefathers who hadbelieved in the past. This verse was revealed regarding 'Abdullah Ibn Salam, Asad and Usayd the sons ofKa'b, Tha'labah Ibn Qays and Salam and Salamah, the nephews of 'Abdullah Ibn Salam, and Yamin IbnYamin. These were the believers from among the people of the Torah. It was said about them: O you whobelieve in Moses and the Torah, believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (and the Scripture which Hehath revealed unto His messenger) Muhammad, i.e. the Qur'an, (and the Scripture which He revealedaforetime) before Muhammad and the Qur'an upon all past prophets. (Whoso disbelieveth in Allah and Hisangels and His scriptures and His messengers and the Last Day) resurrection after death, (he verily hathwandered far astray.) When this verse was revealed all the people mentioned above embraced Islam.
4|137|As for those who did not believe in Muhammad and the Qur'an, Allah then said: (Lo! those who believe) inMoses, (then disbelieve) after Moses (and then (again) believe) in 'Uzayr, (then disbelieve) after 'Uzayr inChrist, (and then increase in disbelief) and then stay firm in their disbelief in Muhammad and the Qur'an,(Allah will never pardon them) as long as they remain unbelievers, (nor will He guide them unto a way) untoa Religion, rightness or a guided way.
4|138|Allah then said about the hypocrites: (Bear unto the hypocrites) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers aswell as all hypocrites till the Day of Judgement (the tidings that for them there is a painful doom) which willextend to their hearts;
4|139|Allah then showed their traits, saying: (Those who choose disbelievers) the Jews (for their friends) when itcomes to assistance and help (instead of believers!) instead of sincere believers. (Do they look for power)might and invincibility (at their hands) the hands of the Jews? (Lo! all power appertaineth to Allah).
4|140|(He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture) He has already commanded you in the Qur'an whenyou were in Mecca (that, when ye hear the revelations of Allah) when you hear the mention of Muhammadand the Qur'an (rejected and derided) when Muhammad and the Qur'an are rejected and derided, ((ye) sitnot with them (who disbelieve and mock)) and engage in the same conversation (until they engage in someother conversation) other than about Muhammad and the Qur'an. (Lo! in that case (if ye stayed)) i.e. if yousit with them without being coerced to do so (ye would be like unto them) in engaging in the sameconversation and in showing derision. (Lo! Allah will gather hypocrites) the hypocrites of Medina: 'AbdullahIbn Ubayy and his followers (and disbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Jahl and his followers, and thedisbelievers of Medina: Ka'b and his followers, (all together, into hell);
4|141|Allah then explained who these people are, saying: (Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you) thosewho lay in wait for hardship and the turn of events to befall you (and, if a victory) triumph and booty(cometh unto you from Allah, say) i.e. the hypocrites say to the sincere believers: (Are we not with you?)are we not following the same religion? Give us then of the booty, (and if the disbelievers) the Jews (meetwith a success) fortune turn in their favour (say: Had we not the mastery of you) did we not divulge, andinform you about, the secrets of Muhammad, (and did we not protect you from the believers?) and did wenot protect you from fighting the believers and informed you about them (Allah will judge between you) Ocongregation of Jews and hypocrites (at the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will not give the disbelievers) theJews (any way (of success) against the believers) He will not always let fortune turn in favour of the Jews tothe detriment of the believers.
4|142|(Lo! the hypocrites) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers (seek to beguile Allah) they disbelieve in Him andoppose Him in secret and think that they are deceiving Him, (but it is Allah Who beguileth them) on the Dayof Judgement when, on the Bridge over hell, the believers will tell them: go back to the life of the world andseek some light, knowing full well that they cannot do so. (When they stand up to worship) when they go toperform the prayer (they perform it languidly) they perform it sluggishly (and to be seen of men) when theysee people, they go to perform the prayer, but when they do see people they do not go, (and are mindful ofAllah) they do not perform the prayer for Allah (but little) to show off and be known by others as peoplewho pray;
4|143|(Swaying between this (and that)) wavering between faith and disbelief: disbelief in secret and faith in frontof people, ((belonging) neither to these) they are not with the believers as far as what is in their heart isconcerned, such that that which is obligated upon the believers is obligated upon them (nor to those) nor dothey belong to the Jews when they declare their faith in public, such that what is prescribed for the Jews isprescribed for them.

4|151|(Such are disbelievers in truth; and for disbelievers) the Jews and other disbelievers (We prepare a shamefuldoom) by means of which they shall be abased; it is also said that this means: a severe torment.
4|152|(But those who believe in Allah and His messengers) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (and makeno distinction between any of them) between the messengers and Allah as far as prophethood andSurrender to Allah are concerned, (unto them Allah will give their wages) their reward in the Hereafter; (andAllah was ever Forgiving) of any one of them who dies, (Merciful) towards anyone who dies in a state ofrepentance.

(They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime) greater thanwhat they have asked you, (for they said: Show us Allah plainly) such that they could see Him with theirown eyes. (The storm of lightning seized them) the Fire burnt them (for their wickedness) for their rejectionof Moses and their boldness vis-�-vis Allah. (Then (even after that) they chose the calf) they worshipped thecalf (after clear proofs) commands and prohibitions (had come unto them. And We forgave them that!)

4|154|(And We caused the Mount to tower above them) We uprooted and fixed the Mount above them (at (thetaking of) their covenant: and We bade them: Enter the gate) the gate of Jericho, (prostrate!) bowing down(and we bade them: Transgress not the Sabbath!) by taking the fish (and We took from them a firmcovenant) regarding Muhammad (pbuh).
4|155|(Then because of their breaking of their covenant) We did with them that which We have done, (and theirdisbelieving in the revelations of Allah) and due to their disbelief in Muhammad and the Qur'an thecapitation tax was imposed on them, (and their slaying) and because of their slaying (of the Prophetswrongfully) without any right, We destroyed them, (and their saying) and because of their saying: (Ourhearts are hardened) our hearts can absorb any kind of knowledge but we cannot understand what you sayand the knowledge you have brought (Nay, but Allah hath set a seal upon them) in fact, it is not as theysay, but Allah has set a seal on their hearts (for their disbelief) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (so that theybelieve not) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (save a few) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers.
4|156|(And because of their disbelief) in Jesus and the Gospel (and of their speaking against Mary a tremendouscalumny) the calumny for which We have turned them into swine;
4|157|(And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger) Allah destroyedtheir man Tatianos. (They slew him not nor crucified, but it appeared so unto them) Allah made Tatianoslook like Jesus and so they killed him instead of him; (and lo! those who disagree concerning it) concerninghis killing (are in doubt thereof) in doubt about his killing; (they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of aconjecture) not even conjecture; (they slew him not for certain) i.e. certainly they did not kill him,
4|158|(But Allah took him up unto Himself) in heaven. (Allah was ever Mighty) in His vengeance against Hisenemies, (Wise) by granting triumph to his friends: He saved His Prophet and destroyed their man.
4|159|(There is not one of the People of the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (but will believe in him) in Jesus,that he was not a sorcerer, Allah, His son or His partner (before his death) after the soul of Jesus expires,that is after he comes down again and then dies after every single Jew in their time, (and on the Day ofResurrection he) Jesus (will be a witness against them) through delivery of the message.
4|160|(Because of the wrong-doing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were (before) made lawfulunto them, and because of their much hindering from Allah's way) and because of their hindering themention of Allah's Religion,
4|161|(And of their taking usury) of their making usury lawful (when they were forbidden it) in the Torah, (and oftheir devouring) and because of their consumption of (people's wealth by false pretences) throughtransgression and bribery, We forbade them the fat which covers the stomach and bowels and the meat andmilk of camels, which were before lawful for them. (We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve)among the Jews (a painful doom) the pain of which will reach to their hearts.
4|162|(But those of them) of the people of the Book: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers who believe in theQur'an and all Scripture even if the Jews did not believe in the former (who are firm in knowledge)knowledge of the Torah (and the believers) all the believers (believe in that which is revealed unto thee) ofthe Qur'an, (and that which was revealed before thee) unto all the prophets, (especially the diligent inprayer) those who perfect their five daily prayers (and those who pay the poor-due) from their wealth alsobelieve in the Qur'an and all the Scriptures, (the believers in Allah and the Last Day) the believers inresurrection after death also believe in the Qur'an and all Scriptures. All these believe in the Qur'an and allScriptures even if the Jews do not believe in them. Allah then explained their reward, saying: (Upon theseWe shall bestow immense reward) an abundant reward in Paradise.
4|163|(Lo! We inspire you) We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an (as We inspired Noah and the prophets afterhim) after Noah, (as We inspired Abraham) We also sent Gabriel to Abraham (and Ishmael and Isaac andJacob and the tribes) the sons of Jacob, (and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and as Weimparted) We gave (unto David the Psalms);
4|164|(And messengers We have mentioned unto thee) by name (before and messengers We have not mentioned)by name (unto thee; and Allah spake directly unto Moses);
4|165|(Messengers) We have sent all these messengers (of good cheer) giving the good news of Paradise forthose who believe (and of warning) of hell for those who disbelieve in Allah, (in order that mankind mighthave no argument) on the Day of Judgement (against Allah after the messengers) after sending themessengers, such that they cannot say: You have not sent us any messenger. (Allah was ever Mighty) in Hisvengeance against those who do not believe in His messenger, (Wise) He decreed that they should believein the messengers.
4|166|Then Allah revealed about the people of Mecca when they said to the Prophet: we have asked the people ofthe Book about you and none of them testifies that you are a prophet sent by Allah, by saying: (But Allah(Himself) testifieth) even if no one else testifies (concerning that which He hath revealed unto thee) theQur'an that Gabriel brought you; (in His knowledge) by His command (hath He revealed it; and the Angelsalso testify) testify to this. (And Allah is sufficient Witness) even if no one else besides Him testifies.
4|167|(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and hinder) people (from the way of Allah) fromAllah's religion and His obedience, (they verily have wandered far astray) from guidance.
4|168|(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and deal in wrong) these are those who ascribepartners to Allah, (Allah will never forgive them) as long as they are thus, (neither will He guide them unto aroad) a road of guidance.
4|169|(Except the road of hell, wherein they will abide for ever) they will remain in hell, never to die or be takenout of it. (And that) abiding in hell for eternity and punishment of these people (is ever easy for Allah).
4|170|(O mankind!) O people of Mecca (The messenger) Muhammad (hath come unto you with the Truth) with thedeclaration of Allah's divine Oneness and the Qur'an (from your Lord. Therefore believe) in Muhammad andthe Qur'an; ((it is) better for you) than that which you are in now. (But if ye disbelieve) in Muhammad andthe Qur'an, (still, lo! Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth) they are all Hisbondsmen and bondswomen. (Allah is ever Knower) of those who believe and those who do not, (Wise) inthat He ordained that they should not worship other than Him.
4|171|Allah then revealed about the Nestorian Christians of Najran who claimed that Jesus was the son of Allahand that Jesus and the Lord are partners, saying: (O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate) do not beextreme (in your religion) for this is not the right course (nor utter aught concerning Allah save the Truth.The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed untoMary) and through His word he became a created being, (and a spirit from Him) and through His command,Jesus became a son without a father. (So believe in Allah and His messengers) all the messengers includingJesus, (and say not "Three") a son, father and wife. (Cease!) from making such a claim and repent ((it is)better for you!) than such a claim. (Allah is only One God) without a son or partner. (Far is it removed fromHis Transcendent Majesty that he should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in theearth) are His servants. (And Allah is sufficient as Defender) as Lord of all created beings and He is witnessof what He says about Jesus.
4|172|(The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah) he will never not acknowledge his servitude to Allah.This was revealed in respect of the Christians saying to the Prophet: "O Muhammad, what you say of Jesusis shameful". Allah said to them: it is not shameful that Jesus be the servant of Allah, (nor will the favouredangels) nor would the favoured angels, the carriers of the Throne, ever not acknowledge that they areservants of Allah. (Whoso scorneth His service) whoever scorns to acknowledge that being his servant (andis proud) is too proud to believe in Allah, (all such) believers and unbelievers (will He assemble unto Him) onthe Day of Judgement.
4|173|(Then, as for those who believed) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and did good works) acts of obedience inthat which is between them and their Lord, (unto them will He pay their wages) their reward in Paradise (infull, adding unto them of His bounty) of His favour; (and as for those who were scornful and proud) tooproud to believe in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (them will He punish with a painful doom). (And they willnot find for them, against Allah, any protecting friend) any relative to benefit them (or helper) to save themfrom Allah's punishment.
4|174|(O mankind!) O people of Mecca! (Now hath a proof from your Lord) a messenger from your Lord:Muhammad (pbuh) (come unto you, and We have sent down unto you) unto your Prophet (a clear light) aScripture that exposits that which is lawful and that which is unlawful;
4|175|(As for those who believe in Allah) as well as in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (and hold fast unto Him) andhold fast to believing in Allah's divine Oneness, (them He will cause to enter into His mercy) in Paradise (andgrace) and they shall also receive His honour, (and will guide them unto Him by a straight road) He willconfirm them on a straight path in this world. He says: He will confirm them in this world in faith and willenter them into Paradise in the Hereafter.
4|176|(They ask thee for a pronouncement) O Muhammad. This verse was revealed about Jabir Ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari who asked the Prophet (pbuh): I have a sister. What do I inherit from her if she dies? So Allah said:they ask you, O Muhammad, about the inheritance of al-Kalalah (Say: Allah hath pronounced for you) Allahclarifies for you (concerning distant kindred) concerning the inheritance of al-Kalalah which is anyone otherthan the father and the son. He said: (If a man dies childless) and his father is also deceased (and he has asister) a full sister, or half sister from his father's side, (hers is half the heritage) left by the deceasedperson, (and he would have inherited from her had she died childless) without sons or daughters. (And ifthere be two sisters) full sisters or half sisters from the father's side, (then theirs are two-thirds of theheritage) that the deceased person has left behind, (and if they be brethren, men and women) male orfemale, full siblings or half siblings from the father, (unto the male is the equivalent of the share of twofemales. Allah expoundeth unto you) the division of estates, (so that ye err not) in the division of estates.(Allah is Knower of all things) of the divisions of estates and other things'.
5|1|And on his authority Ibn 'Abbas said regarding Allah's saying: (O ye who believe! Fulfil your undertakings):'(O ye who believe! Fulfil your undertakings) fulfil the pledges that are between you and Allah or betweenyou and other people; it is also said that this means: fulfil the obligations which have been made obligatoryupon you and which you accepted on the Day of the Covenant and in this Book. (The beast of cattle is madelawful unto you (for food)) you have a legal dispensation to eat of the meat of game such as wild oxen, wildcamels and gazelles (except that which is announced unto you) except that which is recited to you in thissurah, (game being unlawful when ye are on pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct. (Lo! Allah ordaineth thatwhich pleaseth Him) He says: He makes lawful and prohibits what He wills whether you are in a state ofritual consecration or not.
5|2|(O ye who believe! Profane not Allah's monuments) do not make lawful the abstention from all of Allah'srites (nor the Sacred Month) nor attacking people in the Sacred Month (nor the offerings) nor the taking ofofferings which are made to the House (nor the garlands) nor the taking of the garlands which are hung bythe advent of the Sacred Month, (nor those repairing to the Sacred House) nor attacking those who head forAllah's Sacred House, i.e. the pilgrims of al-Yamamah-the clan of the idolater Bakr Ibn Wa'il-and the tradersof the idolater Shurayh Ibn Dabi'ah, (seeking the grace) provision (and pleasure of Allah) by means of thepilgrimage. It is also said that this means: they seek provision by means of trade and also Allah's pleasure.(But when ye have left the sacred territory) after the days of Tashriq, (then go hunting (if ye will)) if youwill, go hunt wild game. (And let not your hatred of a folk) the hatred of the people of Mecca (who (once)stopped your going to the Inviolable Place of Worship) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah (seduce you) drive you(to transgress) against the pilgrims of the clan of Bakr Ibn Wa'il; (but help ye one another untorighteousness) acts of obedience (and pious duty) shunning transgressions. (Help not one another unto sin)contraventions (and transgression) against the pilgrims of the clan of Bakr Ibn Wa'il, (but keep your duty toAllah) fear Allah in that which He has commanded and prohibited you. (Lo! Allah is severe in punishment)when He punishes those who abstain from that which He has commanded.
5|3|Allah then explained what He made unlawful for them, saying: (Forbidden unto you (for food) are carrion)He says: eating carrion is forbidden for you because He has commanded that it be immolated (and blood)which is shed (and swine flesh, and that which hath been dedicated unto any other than Allah) in purpose,(and the strangled) that which is strangled with a rope until it dies, (and the dead through beating) thebeast beaten by a piece of wood until it dies, (and the dead through falling from a height) or in a well andwhich dies as a consequence, (and that which has been killed by (the goring of) horns, and the devoured ofwild beasts) as a prey, (saving that which ye make lawful) except that which you find on the verge of dyingand make it lawful by immolating it, (and that which hath been immolated unto idols. And (forbidden is it)that you swear by the divining arrows) He says: He has forbidden your use of divining arrows. They were inthe habit of writing on some arrows: "My Lord commands me", and on others "My Lord forbids me" and thenuse the divination method associated with it to decide their affairs, and so Allah prohibited them fromengaging in such activity. (This) that which I have mentioned to you of transgressions and the unlawful (isan abomination) engaging in them is an abomination and declaring them lawful is an act of disbelief. (Thisday) the day of the greater pilgrimage, the farewell pilgrimage (are those who disbelieve) the unbelievers ofMecca (in despair of your religion) in despair of you religion reverting to theirs after you left their religionand its laws; (so fear them not) in relation to following the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and opposing them(fear Me!) if you abstain from following Muhammad and his religion and follow them. (This day) the day ofthe pilgrimage (have I perfected your religion for you) I have elucidated to you the prescriptions of yourreligion: the lawful and the unlawful, the commands and the prohibitions (and completed My favour untoyou) I have completed My blessing upon you in that, after today, no idolater will ever gather with you in'Arafat, Mina, in the circumambulation around the Ka'bah, and in the coming and going between al-Safa andal-Marwah, (and have chosen for you as religion al-Islam. Whoso is forced by hunger) whoever is forced toeat the meat of carrion upon necessity, (not by will to sin) not wilfully intending to commit a sin; it is alsosaid that this means: not purposefully wanting to eat without a necessity: ((for him) lo! Allah is Forgiving) ifhe eats to satiety, (Merciful) when He gave legal dispensation to eat the meat of carrion upon necessity inorder to gain strength but it is legally reprehensible (makruh) to eat to satiety.
5|4|(They ask thee) O Muhammad; the people who so asked were Zayd Ibn Muhalhil al-Ta'i and 'Adiyy IbnHatim al-Ta'i, both fishermen (what is made lawful for them) of game. (Say : (all) good things) all theimmolated ones (are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained ashounds are trained, ye teach them) to abstain from eating game (that which Allah taught you) as Allah hastaught you; (so eat of that which they) the trained dogs (catch for you and mention Allah's name upon it)upon immolating your game; and it is also said: upon sending the trained dogs upon the game, (andobserve your duty to Allah) fear Allah about eating the meat of carrion. (Lo! Allah is swift to take account)His punishment is severe; it is also said that this means: when He is swift when He takes people to task.
5|5|(This day) the day of the pilgrimage (are (all) good things) that which has been immolated (made lawful foryou. The food) the animals immolated (of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you) as long asit is not prohibited, (and your food) your immolated animals (is lawful for them) both the Jews andChristians can consume that which the Muslims immolate. (And so are the) free (virtuous women of thebelievers) are lawful for you to marry (and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture beforeyou) lawful for you to marry (when ye give them their marriage portions) their dowry, in surplus of the pricegiven to the prostitute in exchange for sex (and live with them in honour) in wedlock, (not in) flagrant(fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines.) This was revealed about the women of Mecca whenthey boasted to the women of Medina. Allah said: (Whoso denieth the faith) Allah's divine Oneness, (hiswork is vain) in this world (and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter) he will be of those who havebeen duped since he will be deprived of Paradise and enter hell.
5|6|(O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer) and you are not in a state of minor ritual purity, He hastaught you what to do, saying: (wash your face, and your hands up to the elbows, and lightly rub yourheads) as you please (and (wash) your feet) above the sole of the feet (up to the ankles. And if ye areunclean) if you are in a state of major ritual impurity, (purify yourselves) with water. (And if ye are sick) ofsmallpox or are wounded. This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn 'Awf (or on a journey, or one of youcometh from the closet) or one of you has urinated or defecated, (or ye have had (sexual) contact withwomen) or had sex with women, (and ye find not water) you are unable to use water, (then go to clean,high ground and rub your faces) with the first blow (and your hands) with the second blow (with some of it)i.e. some of the dust. (Allah would not place a burden) constraint (on you, but He would purify you) bymeans of dry ablution from minor and major ritual impurities (and would perfect His grace) His favour (uponyou, that ye may give thanks) for His blessing and legal dispensation.
5|7|(Remember Allah's grace) recollect Allah's blessing (upon you) through faith (and His covenant) pledge (bywhich He bound you) with which He commanded you on the Day of the Covenant (when you said: We hear)Your words, O our Lord, (and we obey) Your command; (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in thatwhich He commanded and prohibited you. (Allah knoweth what is in the breasts (of men)) of loyalty andbetrayal.
5|8|(O ye who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity) in justice, (and let not hatred of any people)the hatred of Shurayh Ibn Shurahbil (seduce you) drive you (that ye deal not justly) with the pilgrims of theclan of Bakr Ibn Wa'il. (Deal justly) with them, (that is nearer to your duty) justice is nearer to God-fearingness as far as the God-fearing are concerned. (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regardingjustice and injustice. (Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do) whether it is justice or injustice.
5|9|(Allah hath promised those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts ofobedience regarding that which is between them and their Lord: (Theirs will be forgiveness) of their sins inthis world (and immense reward) in Paradise.
5|10|(And they who disbelieve) in Allah (and deny Our revelations) Muhammad and the Qur'an, (such are rightfulowners of hell) the dwellers of the Fire.
5|11|(O ye who believe!) i.e. Muhammad and his Companions (Remember Allah's favour unto you) recollectAllah's grace by driving away from you the harm of the enemy, (how a people) the people of the BanuQurayzah (were minded to stretch out their hands against you) to kill you (but He withheld) He prevented(their hands from you) from killing you; (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in relation to that which Hehas commanded you. (In Allah let believers put their trust) the believers should rely on Allah.
5|12|(Allah made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel) the acknowledgement of the Children of Israel inthe Torah of Muhammad, that they shall worship none except Allah and that they shall not ascribe partnersto Him (and We raised among them twelve chieftains) 12 messengers; and it is said: 12 kings, a king toeach tribe: (and Allah said) to these kings: (Lo! I am with you) I will help you. (If you establish worship) ifyou establish the prayer which has been made obligatory upon you (and pay the poor-due) from yourwealth, (and believe in) acknowledge and accept (My messengers) who are sent to you (and support them)and assist them with the sword against the enemy, (and lend unto Allah a kindly loan) genuinely from yourheart, (surely I shall remit your sins) other than the enormities, (and surely I shall bring you into Gardensbeneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) rivers of water, milk, wine and honey (flow. Whosoamong you disbelieveth after this) after accepting and acknowledging the covenant (will go astray from aplain road) such a person has erred from the road of guidance. Nonetheless, they disbelieved except five ofthem.
5|13|Allah then explained the punishment of those who had disbelieved, saying: (And because of their) i.e. thekings (breaking their covenant, We have cursed them) We punished them through imposing the capitationtax upon them (and made hard) and lightless (their hearts. They change words from their context) theychange the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) and the legal ruling on stoning [married people whofornicate] after this was exposited upon in the Torah (and forget a part) and leave part (of that whereofthey were admonished) they were commanded with in the Torah concerning their following of Muhammad(pbuh) and manifesting his traits and description to others. Allah then showed their betrayal of the Prophet(pbuh) saying: (Thou wilt not) O Muhammad (cease to discover treachery) and contravention (from all) i.e.the Banu Qurayzah (save a few of them) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers. (But bear with them) andpunish them not (and pardon them) and leave them. (Lo! Allah loveth the kindly) towards others.
5|14|(And with those who say: "Lo! we are Christians"), i.e. the Christians of Najran (We made a covenant) in theGospel that they should follow Muhammad (pbuh) and manifest his traits and not worship anyone oranything except Allah or associate anyone with Him, (but they forgot a part) they left part (of that whereofthey were admonished) with which they were commanded. (Therefore We have stirred up) We have cast(enmity) killing and destruction (and hatred) in the hearts (among them) between the Jews and Christians;and it is said between the Nestorians of Najran, the sects known as the Jacobites, the Marqusiyya and theMelkites (till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will inform them of their handiwork) of their opposition,treachery, concealment, enmity and hatred.
5|15|(O people of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (come unto you, expositing untoyou much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture) regarding the traits and description of the ProphetMuhammad (pbuh) and the legal ruling on stoning [married fornicators] as well as other things, (andforgiving much) and leave many other things, not mentioning them to you. (Now hath come unto you light)a messenger, i.e. Muhammad (from Allah and a plain Scripture) explaining the lawful and the unlawful,
5|16|(Whereby) i.e. through Muhammad and the Qur'an (Allah guideth him who seeketh His good pleasure) Hisdivine Oneness (unto paths of peace) the religion of Islam, and the Peace (al-Salam) is Allah. (He bringeththem out of darkness unto light) He brings them out of disbelief to faith (by His decree) by His command; itis also said that this means: by His given success and grace, (and guideth them unto a straight path) Heconfirms them on that religion after they accept it.
5|17|(They indeed have disbelieved who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary) this is the claim of theJacobites. (Say) to these Christians, O Muhammad: (Who then can do aught against Allah) who can savefrom Allah's punishment, (if He had willed to destroy) to punish (the Messiah son of Mary, and his motherand everyone on earth?) who worshipped her. (Allah's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth) toHim belong the stores of the heavens and earth (and all that is between them) of created things andmarvels.

5|18|(The Jews) the Jews of Medina (and Christians) the Christians of Najran (say: We are sons of Allah) we arethe sons and prophets of Allah (and His loved ones) who follow His religion; it is also said that this means:we follow Allah's religion as if we were His sons and loved ones; and it is said that this means: we are toAllah like His sons and we are followers of His religion. (Say) to the Jews, O Muhammad; (Why then doth Hechastise you for your sins) due to worshipping the calf for 40 days, if you are like sons to Him; have youever seen a father torturing his sons with fire? (Nay, ye are but mortals) created servants (of His creating)like all His other created beings.

So putyour trust (in Allah)) that you will be victorious (if ye are indeed believers) it is also said that the two menwho said this are two men from the assassins who feared Moses and with whom Allah was gracious bybestowing upon them belief in Allah's divine Oneness.

5|32|(For that) because Cain wrongfully killed Abel (cause We decreed for the Children of Israel) in the Torah(that whosoever killeth a human being for other than man slaughter) i.e. premeditatedly (or corruption inthe earth) or because of idolatry, (it shall be as if be had killed all mankind) Hell will be decreed for him forpremeditatedly and wrongfully killing a human being, as though he killed all mankind, (and whoso saveththe life of one) whoever abstains from killing a person, (it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind)Paradise will be decreed for him for sparing one soul, as though he spared the lives of all mankind. (Ourmessengers came unto them) i.e. the Children of Israel (of old with clear proofs) with commands,prohibitions and signs, (but afterwards lo! many of them) the Children of Israel (became) after themessengers (prodigals in the earth) ascribing partners to Allah.
5|33|The following verse was revealed about the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir who killed a group of people fromthe Banu Kinanah. This group wanted to emigrate to Medina to see Allah's Messenger (pbuh) and declaretheir Islam. However, they were all killed and their belongings taken as booty. Hence, Allah explained thepunishment of the people of the Banu Hilal, who were idolaters, saying: (The only reward) requital (of thosewho make war upon Allah and His messenger) of those who disbelieve in Allah and His messenger (andstrive after corruption in the land) and engage in sin in the land, i.e. by wrongfully killing others and takingtheir properties (will be that they will be killed) He says: the punishment of one who kills and does not takethe victim's property is that he be killed (or crucified) He says: the punishment of one who kills a person andalso takes his property is that he be crucified, (or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off) theright hand and the left leg. He says: the punishment of one who takes another's property but does not kill isthat his hand and leg be cut off, (or will be expelled out of the land) or he will be put in prison until hedisplays righteousness and his repentance becomes apparent. Allah says: the punishment of someone whoterrorises people as a highway robber but does not kill or take anyone's property is that he be imprisoned.(Such) that which I have mentioned (will be their degradation) their punishment (in the world, and in theHereafter theirs will be an awful doom) more severe than their punishment which they suffered in this world,that is, if the person does not repent;
5|34|Allah then showed that He pardons those who repent, saying: (Save those who repent) from disbelief andidolatry (before ye overpower them) i.e. before you capture them. (For know that Allah is Forgiving) Hepardons, (Merciful) towards him who repents.
5|35|(O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (Be mindful of your duty to Allah) regarding that whichHe has commanded you, (and seek the way of approach unto Him) seek the highest rank; it is also said thatthis means: seek with Him high degrees through righteous works, (and strive in His way) in His obedience(in order that ye may succeed) so that you escape His wrath and torment and so that you attain to faith.
5|36|(As for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (lo! if all) the wealth (that is in the were theirs,and as much again therewith) and double of it with it, (to ransom them from the doom on the day ofResurrection, it) the ransom (would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom).
5|37|(They will wish to come forth from the Fire) by changing one state into another, (but they will not comeforth from it) from the Fire. (Theirs will be a lasting doom) which will never be interrupted.
5|38|(As for the thief, both male) i.e. Tu'mah (and female, cut off their hands) the right hands. (It is the rewardof their own deeds) as a punishment for their theft, (an exemplary punishment from Allah) a disgrace forthem from Allah. (Allah is Mighty) in showing His anger towards the thief, (Wise) in that He decreed for himthe cutting off of his hand.
5|39|(But whoso repenteth after his wrong-doing) after his theft and being punished for it (and amendeth) thatwhich is between him and his Lord through repentance, (lo! Allah will relent towards him) Allah will forgivehim. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He pardons, (Merciful) towards him who repents.
5|40|(Knowest thou not) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that Unto Allah belongeththe Sovereignty) the stores (of the heavens and the earth?

O Muhammad (Let not them grieve you who vie one with another in the race to disbelief) inallying themselves with the disbelievers in this world and in the Hereafter, (of such as say with their mouths)with their tongues: ("We believe,") in our hearts (but their hearts believe not) i.e. the hearts of thehypocrites, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers, (and of the Jews) i.e. the Jews of the Banu Qurayzah,Ka'b and his followers: (listeners for the sake of falsehood) listeners of untruth, (listeners on behalf of otherfolk) the people of Khaybar (who come not unto thee) regarding what happened among them, but BanuQurayzah asked about them, (changing words) changing the traits and description of Muhammad and thelegal ruling on the stoning of married people who commit adultery (from their context) after being expositedin the Torah (and saying) i.e. the leaders to their followers; it is also said: the hypocrites 'Abdullah IbnUbayy and his followers: (If this be given unto you) if Muhammad (pbuh) command you to whip [marriedpeople who committed adultery], (receive it) accept it from him and act according to it (but if this be notgiven unto you) if Muhammad does not command you to whip them and instead commands you to stonethem, (then beware!) i.e. beware of following him if does not command you to whip them and, instead,commands you to stone them. Allah said: (He whom Allah doometh unto sin) he whom Allah wants topersist in his disbelief and idolatry; it is also said: he whom Allah wants to expose; and it is also said thatthis means: he whom Allah wants to test, (thou (by thine efforts) will avail him naught against Allah) againstAllah's punishment. (Those are) the Jews and the hypocrites (they for whom the will of Allah is that Hecleanse not their hearts) from scheming, treachery and persistence in disbelief. (Theirs in the world will beignominy) punishment through killing and expulsion, (and in the Hereafter an awful doom) more severe thanthe punishment they suffer in this world;
5|42|(Listeners) and ones who utter words (for the sake of falsehood! Greedy for illicit gain!) bribery and thatwhich is unlawful by changing the rulings of Allah.

(If thoudisclaimest jurisdiction) and do not judge between them, (then they cannot harm thee at all) they cannottake away anything from you. (But if thou judgest) between the Banu Qurayzah and the Banu'l-Nadir; and itis also said: between the people of Khaybar, (judge between them with equity) with stoning [married peoplewho commit adultery]. (Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) who are fair when they judge with the Book of Allahand who apply the legal ruling of stoning.
5|43|(How come they unto thee for judgement) regarding stoning, this is mentioned by way of showingamazement (when they have the Torah, wherein) in the Torah (Allah hath delivered judgement (for them))the judgement of stoning?

(And barter not My revelations) throughconcealment of the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) and the verse of stoning (for a little gain) fora paltry portion in your means of living. (Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed) Allah says:whoever does not show that which Allah has shown in the Torah regarding the traits and description ofMuhammad and the verse of stoning: (such are disbelievers) in Allah, the messenger and the Scripture.
5|45|(And We prescribed for them) We obligated on the Children of Israel (therein) in the Torah: (The life for thelife) that is premeditatedly killed as an expiation for this killing, (and the eye for the eye) that ispremeditatedly ruined as an expiation for this ruination, (and the nose for the nose) that is premeditatedlydamaged as an expiation for this damage, (and the ear for the ear) that is premeditatedly harmed as anexpiation for this harm, (and the tooth for the tooth) that is premeditatedly broken as an expiation for thisbreaking, (and for wounds retaliation) as a just judgement. (But whoso forgoeth it (in the way of charity))whoever forgoes retaliating (it shall be expiation for him) i.e. for the harmed person; it is also said: for theperson who harmed.

5|46|(And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) beforehim in the Torah) as regards the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness and some laws, (and We bestowed onhim the Gospel wherein is guidance) from error (and a light) an exposition on stoning, (confirming thatwhich was (revealed) before it in the Torah) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and the legal ruling of stoning(a guidance) from error (and an admonition unto) and a caution for (those who ward off (evil)) those whoward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies.
5|47|(Let the People of the Gospel judge) such that the people of the Gospel elucidate (by that which Allah hathrevealed therein) that which Allah has elucidated in the Gospel regarding the traits and description ofMuhammad (pbuh) and the legal ruling of stoning.

5|48|(And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture) We have sent you Gabriel with the Qur'an (with the Truth)to make plain the Truth and falsehood, (confirming) the statement of Allah's divine Oneness and some laws(whatever Scripture was before it) whatever Scriptures were before it, (and a watcher over it) a witnessupon all the Scriptures before it; it is also said: a witness upon the ruling of stoning; and it is also said: awatcher over all previous Scriptures.

5|50|(Is it a judgement of the time of (pagan) ignorance that they are seeking?) to find in the Qur'an, OMuhammad. (Who is better than Allah for judgement to a people who have certainty?) in Muhammad andthe Qur'an.
5|51|(O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (Take not the Jews and Christians for friends) seekingtheir assistance and help. (They are friends one to another) He says: some are followers of the religion ofothers in secret and in the open, just as they are friends of each other. (He among you) O group of believers(who taketh them for friends) seeking their assistance and help (is (one) of them) in alliance and is notincluded in Allah's protection and safety. (Lo!

(Andit may) "may ['asa]" when used in connection with Allah denotes a requisite (happen that Allah willvouchsafe (unto you) the victory) the Conquest of Mecca and victory to Muhammad (pbuh) and hisCompanions (or a commandment from His presence) or a punishment inflicted on the Banu Qurayzah andBanu'l-Nadir, by means of killing and expelling them.

(Allah is All-Embracing)Allah is Generous in His gift, (All-Knowing) to whom He gives.
5|55|Then Allah revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions-Asad, Usayd, Tha'labah Ibn Qays andothers-when they were shunned by the Jews, saying: (Your friend) your protector, helper and intimatecompanion (can be only Allah; and His messenger and those who believe) i.e. Abu Bakr and his companions,(who establish worship) the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from their wealth, (and bow down (inprayer)) in the five daily prayers in congregation with the Prophet (pbuh).
5|56|(And whoso taketh Allah and His messenger and those who believe) Abu Bakr and his fellow believers,seeking their assistance and help (for friend (will know that), lo! the party of Allah) the soldiers of Allah, i.e.Muhammad and his Companions (they are the victorious) over their enemies.
5|57|(O ye who believe!

5|58|(And when ye call to prayer) through the call to prayer (adhan) and the call announcing the start of theprayer (iqamah) (they take it for a jest and sport) they take it as a joke and falsehood. (That) jest (isbecause they are a folk who understand not) Allah's command nor do they know Allah's divine Oneness norHis religion. This verse was revealed about a Jewish man who used to poke fun at Bilal's call to prayer, andso Allah burned him.
5|59|(Say) to the Jews, O Muhammad: (O, People of the Scripture! Do ye blame us) do you accuse, and find faultwith, us (for aught else than that we believe in Allah) for any other reason except for our faith in Allah,alone without any partners (and that which is revealed unto us) the Qur'an (and that which was revealedaforetime) of Scriptures and of messengers sent before Muhammad (pbuh) and before the Qur'an, (andbecause most of you) all of you (are evil-doers) disbelievers?
5|60|Allah then revealed about their saying: "we do not know any religious community that is more disfavouredthan Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions", saying: (Shall I tell thee of a worse (case) than theirs) thatwhich is worse than what you told Muhammad and his Companions (for retribution with Allah) for him whois going to be punished by Allah? (Worse (is the case of him) whom Allah hath cursed) imposing on him thecapitation tax, (him on whom His wrath hath fallen! Worse is he of whose sort Allah hath turned some toapes) in the time of the Prophet David (pbuh) (and swine) in the time of Jesus, after eating from the tablethat Allah sent from heaven, (and who serveth idols) soothsayers and devils; or he whom Allah has madethe worshipper of the devil, idols and soothsayers. (Such are in worse plight) worse in works in this worldand worse in status in the Hereafter (and further astray from the plain road) the road of guidance.

(Verily evil is what they do) of contraventions and violations against others.
5|63|(Why do not the rabbis) the recluse in their cloisters (and the priests) the men of knowledge (forbid theirevil speaking) their idolatry (and their devouring of illicit gain) bribery and that which unlawful? (Verily evil istheir handiwork) their abstention from forbidding them to do so.
5|64|(The Jews) Finhas Ibn 'Azura', the Jew (say: Allah's hand is fettered) and cannot give.

Nay, but both His hands are spread out wide inbounty) His hands are wide open for both the righteous and the sinner. (He bestoweth as He will) if Hewishes, He gives, and if He wishes, He withholds.

As often as they light a fire for war) whenever they unite to kill Muhammad out ofdisobedience, (Allah extinguisheth it) Allah makes them disunite and oppose each other. (Their effort is forcorruption in the land) they cause corruption in the land through preventing people from Muhammad and byinviting to other than Allah, (and Allah loveth not corrupters) the Jews and their religion.
5|65|(If only the People of the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (would believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an(and ward off (evil)) repent of Judaism and Christianity, (surely We should remit their sins from them) thosewhich they committed when they were Jews or Christians (and surely We should bring them into Gardens ofDelight) in the Hereafter.
5|66|(If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel) if they had accepted what is in the Torah and the Gospeland demonstrated the traits and description of Muhammad contained therein (and that which was revealedunto them from their Lord) and had they elucidated that which their Lord had explained to them in theTorah and the Gospel; it is also said that this means: if they had believed that all the scriptures andmessengers are from their Lord, (they would surely have been nourished from above them) through rain(and from beneath their feet) through vegetation and fruit. (Among them) among the people of the Book(there are people who are moderate) a group of just and upright people, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and hisfollowers, the monk Bahirah, the Negus and his followers, and Salman al-Farisi and his fellows, (but many ofthem are of evil conduct) evil is what they do in terms of concealing the traits and description ofMuhammad. Among such people are Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Ka'b Ibn Asad, Malik Ibn al-Sayf, Sa'id Ibn 'Amr,Abu Yasir, and Judayy Ibn Akhtab.

Some (of them) they denied) they denied Jesus andMuhammad, Allah bless both of them (and some they slew) like Zachariah and John.
5|71|(They thought no harm would come of it,) no misfortune would ensue; it is also said that: they thought thattheir hearts would not be corrupted because of denying and killing messengers (so they were wilfully blind)and did not see guidance (and deaf) such that they did not hear the Truth deep in their hearts.

(That) affection (is because there are among thempriests) ascetics whose heads are shaved in the middle (and monks) secluded in monasteries who are theirmen of knowledge, (and because they are not proud) in believing in Muhammad and the Qur'an.
5|83|(When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messenger) when they hear Ja'far Ibn AbiTalib's recitation of what has been revealed to the messenger, (thou seest their eyes overflow with tearsbecause of their recognition of the Truth) their recognition of the traits and description of Muhammad(pbuh) in their Scripture. (They say: Our Lord) O our Lord, (we believe) in You, in Your Book and in YourMessenger Muhammad. (Inscribe us as among the witnesses) make us of the Community of Muhammad(pbuh) who believe.
5|84|When their own people blamed them for believing, they said: (How should we not believe in Allah and thatwhich hath come unto us of the Truth) He says: and also believe in the Truth that has come to us fromScripture and the Messenger. (And (how should we not) hope that our Lord will) in the Hereafter in Paradise(bring us in along with righteous folk) the righteous among the Community of Muhammad (pbuh)?
5|85|(Allah hath rewarded them) has decreed for them (for that their saying) for declaring their faith voluntarily.(Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitation (rivers) of water, milk, wine and honey (flow,wherein they will abide for ever) remaining in Paradise for ever, never to die or be removed from it. (That)which I have mentioned (is the reward of the good) who testify to Allah's divine Oneness; it is also said thatthe good means those who are kind in speech and action.
5|86|(But those who disbelieve) in Allah (and deny Our revelations) Muhammad and the Qur'an, (they are ownersof hellfire) they are the folk of hell.
5|87|(O ye who believe! Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you) this verse was revealedabout ten Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) among them were Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Ali, 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud,'Uthman Ibn Maz'un al-Jumahi, Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi, and Salim the client of Abu Hudhayfah Ibn'Utbah, Salman al-Farisi, Abu Dharr, 'Ammar Ibn Yasir-these Companions vowed in the house of 'Uthman IbnMaz'un that they would not eat or drink except that which was enough to keep them alive, that they wouldnot have sex with their wives, that they would never eat meat or fat and that they would cut off their maleorgans. But Allah forbade them from such acts, and revealed about them: do not forbid the lawful thingsthat Allah has permitted such as foods, drinks and having sex with your wives (and transgress not) bycutting off your male organs. (Lo! Allah loveth not transgressors) who move from the lawful to the unlawfulby mutilating themselves.
5|88|(Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah inWhom ye are believers) fear Allah regarding mutilation and forbidding that which He has made lawful.
5|89|(Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths) Allah does not take you to taskfor the expiation of unintentional oaths, (but He will take you to task for the oaths which ye swear inearnest) He takes you to task for the intention of your hearts when you make oaths. (The expiation thereof)the expiation of the oath which is not unintentional (is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average ofthat wherewith ye feed your own folk) of bread and seasoning which you feed to them at lunch and dinner,(or the clothing of them) or the clothing of ten needy people whereby their nudity is covered: a shawl, agown or a loin cloth, (or the liberation of a slave) whichever it is of these three options, (and for him whofinds not (the wherewithal to do so)) any one of these three options (then a three day fast) consecutively.(This) which I have mentioned (is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn) and do not honour youroath; (and keep your oaths) the uttering of your oaths as well as the expiation of your oaths. (Thus Allahexpoundeth unto you His revelations) His commands and prohibitions, as He expounds the expiation ofoaths (in order that ye may give thanks) in order that you may show gratitude for expositing His commandsand prohibitions.
5|90|(O ye who believe! Strong drink) which intoxicates the mind (and games of chance) all types of games ofchance (and idols) the worship of idols (and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork) theyare unlawful because they are instigated by order of the devil and his whispering. (Leave it aside) avoid it (inorder that ye may succeed) in order that you may escape Allah's anger and punishment and be safe in theHereafter.
5|91|(Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink) when you becomedrunk (and games of chance) when you loose your money, (and to turn you from remembrance of Allah) Hesays: intoxicants drive you from the obedience of Allah (and from (His) worship) He says: it also preventsyou from performing the five daily prayers. (Will ye then have done?) will you then stop from indulging inthem.
5|92|(Obey Allah and obey the messenger) regarding the prohibition of intoxicant drinks, (and beware!) ofdeclaring them lawful or of drinking them. (But if ye turn away) from obeying them in relation to theprohibition of intoxicant drinks, (then know that the duty of Our messenger) Muhammad (is only plain) i.e.in a language that you understand (conveyance (of the message)) on behalf of Allah.
5|93|Then Allah revealed about a group of men from the Emigrants and the Helpers who asked the Prophet(pbuh): "what shall happen to those of us who died drinking intoxicant drinks before they were madeunlawful", saying: (There shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an(and do good works) that is between them and their Lord (for what they may have eaten (in the past)) forwhat they have drunk in the past before intoxicants were made unlawful, whether those who did it are deador still living. (So be mindful of your duty (to Allah)) if they warded off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies,(and do good works) that is between them and their Lord; (and again: be mindful of your duty) ward offmaking intoxicants lawful after they were made unlawful; this address is to the believers who are still living,(and believe) in the unlawfulness of intoxicant; (and once again: be mindful of your duty) ward off drinkingit, (and do right) leave the drinking of it. (Allah loveth the good) for avoiding drinking intoxicants; thisrelates to those who were still alive and who drunk intoxicants before they were made unlawful.
5|94|Then Allah revealed the unlawfulness of game in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, saying: (O ye who believe) inMuhammad and the Qur'an! (Allah will surely try you somewhat (in the matter) of the game) He will test youregarding the game you pursue on land (which ye take) of their eggs and little ones (with your hands andyour spears) to catch wild animals in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, (that Allah may know) that Allah may see(him who feareth Him in secret) and thus leave the game. (Whoso transgresseth) intentionally (after this)after Allah has decreed the requital and ruling of this, (for him there is a painful doom) a painful beatingwhich will extend to his back and belly.
5|95|(O ye who believe! Kill no wild game while ye are on the pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct. (Whoso ofyou killeth it of set purpose) this verse was revealed about Abu'l-Yusr Ibn 'Amr who intentionally killedgame, forgetting he was in ritual consecration, (he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which hehath killed, of domestic animals, the judge to be two men among you known for justice) two judges willevaluate such equivalence; ((the forfeit) to be brought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or, for expiation, heshall feed poor persons) or he should give money for it by feeding some of the poor of Mecca, (or theequivalent thereof in fasting) if he cannot feed the poor, he should fast one for each half measure (Sa') offood he is supposed to feed to the poor, (that he may taste the evil consequences) the punishment (of hisdeed. Allah forgiveth whatever (of this kind) may have happened in the past) before it was made unlawful,(but whoso relapseth) after being condemned and beaten severely in this world, (Allah will take retributionfrom him) he should be left until Allah takes retribution from him. (Allah is Mighty) in His retribution, (Able toRequite (the wrong)) Able to punish those who do wrong.
5|96|(To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you) this was revealed about a people from theBanu Mudlij who lived off the sea. They asked the Prophet (pbuh) about the fish of the sea and about thatwhich is washed out of the sea, so Allah revealed that it is lawful to fish just as it is lawful to eat that whichis washed out by the sea (a provision for you) a benefit for you (and for seafarers; but to hunt on land isforbidden you so long as ye are on the pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct. (Be mindful of your duty toAllah) fear Allah, (unto Whom ye will be gathered) and questioned about the game made forbidden for youduring ritual consecration and at the Sacred Precinct.
5|97|(Allah hath appointed the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a standard) a sanctuary and an emblem (for mankind)for the purpose of worship, (and the Sacred Month) is a time of security (and the offerings) which areoffered to the House as a gesture of security to the company of people who are present where the offeringis made (and the garlands) i.e. the offerings which carry garlands made of the barks of the trees of theSacred Precinct, as a gesture of security to the company of people there. (That) which I have mentioned (isso that ye may know that Allah knoweth whatsoever) the benefit of (is in the heavens and whatsoever is inthe earth, and that Allah is Knower of all things) their benefits and also that which is good for the people ofthe heavens and the earth.
5|98|(Know that Allah is severe in punishment) towards him who declares lawful that which Allah has madeunlawful, (but that Allah (also) is Forgiving) He overlooks mistakes, (Merciful) towards the person whorepents.
5|99|(The duty of the messenger is only to convey (the message)) on behalf of Allah. (Allah knoweth what yeproclaim) what you display publicly of good and evil (and what ye hide) of good or evil; it is also said thatthis means: Allah knows what you display among yourselves and that which you conceal from one anotherin relation to taking the money of Shurayh.
5|100|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Sarh who brought Shurayh's property: (The evil) the unlawful:Shurayh's property, (and the good) the lawful property which Shurayh brought (are not alike even thoughthe plenty of the evil) that which is unlawful (attract thee. So be mindful of your duty to Allah) fear Allahregarding taking that which is unlawful, (O men of understanding) O people possessed of mind and reason,(that ye may succeed) that you may be saved from Allah's wrath and torment.
5|101|(O ye who believe!) this was revealed about Harith Ibn Yazid who asked the Prophet (pbuh)-when the verse(And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind) was revealed: "Is it once every year, OMessenger of Allah?" So Allah forbade him from asking such questions, and started by addressing him with(O ye who believe!), (Ask not) your Prophet (of things) that Allah has relieved you of (which, if they weremade known unto you) if they were made obligatory upon you, (would trouble you; but if you ask of them)if you ask of the things that you were relieved of (when the Qur'an is being revealed) when Gabriel bringsdown the Qur'an, (they will be made known unto you) they will be made obligatory upon you. (Allahpardoneth this) this questioning, (for Allah is Forgiving) of the one who repents, (Clement) vis-�-vis yourignorance.
5|102|(A folk before you asked) their prophets ((for such disclosures) and then disbelieved there in) when thingswere made clear to them, they disbelieved in them.
5|103|(Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a Wasilah or a Hami) He says:Allah has not prohibited the Bahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah or the Hami. As for the Bahirah, it was thenorm that if a she-camel delivered on its fifth birthing a male camel, the latter would be immolated and bothmen and women would eat from it, but if it were a female, they would cleave its ear. The latter is called aBahirah. The latter's milk and benefits were for men only, to the exclusion of women, and when she diedboth men and women could share her meat. As for the Sa'ibah, people used to give whatever they werewilling to give of cattle and hand it over to the custodians of idols. The latter would offer it to travellers whopassed by, the men not the women. The animals offered were also male and never female. When these diedboth men and women shared its meat. As for the Wasilah, when a sheep had delivered seven times, theyused to check the seventh birth. If it were male, they used to immolate it and its meat was shared by menand women. If it were female, women would not be allowed to benefit from it until the animal died. Whenthe animal died, both men and women shared its meat. If it were a twin delivery, male and female, bothwere spared for the benefit of men only, until their death. When the animal died, both men and womenshared their meat. As for the Ham, it is the male camel whose offspring has produced its own offspring, it issaid that such an animal has protected its back. This animal is left alone: it is not used for riding ortransporting things. It cannot be stopped from drinking of any water or grazing in any pasture, nor can it bestopped from copulating with any she-camel that comes its way. When this animal gets too old or dies, itsmeat is shared by men and women. Allah says that He did not prescribe any of these practices describedabove; (but those who disbelieve) i.e. 'Amr ibn Luhayy and his followers (invent a lie against Allah) bydeclaring the above unlawful [for some]. (Most of them) all of them (have no sense) in relation to Allah'scommand, that which He has made lawful and that which He has made unlawful.
5|104|(And when it is said unto them) when the Prophet (pbuh) said to the idolaters of Mecca: (Come unto thatwhich Allah hath revealed) come and make lawful that which Allah has clarified in the Qur'an (and unto themessenger) and come to that which the Messenger has shown you to be lawful, (they say: Enough for us)enough prohibition for us (is that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers had noknowledge whatsoever) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and religion, (and no guidance) to the practice ofany prophet; it is also said that this means: were not their fathers completely ignorant of the religion andnot guided to the practice of the Prophet? How then can their example be followed?
5|105|(O ye who believe! Ye have charge of your own souls) hasten to save your own persons. (He who erreth)the error of the one who errs (cannot injure you if you are rightly guided) to faith and further show theirerror. (Unto Allah ye will all return) after you die; (and then He will inform you of what ye used to do) andsay of good and evil. This verse was revealed about the idolaters of Mecca when the Prophet (pbuh)accepted the capitation tax from the people of the Book and then refused to take it from them. This storyhas already been mentioned in surah al-Baqarah.
5|106|(O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you) in settlement or upon travelling (when deathdraweth nigh unto one of you, at the time of bequest) of the dead person (two witnesses) should testify,just men from among you) two free men; it is also said: two of your own people, (or two others fromanother tribe) who adhere to your religion, as it is said that this means: two people from outside your ownpeople. Then, leaving the question in the case of settlement, Allah mentioned the same question in the caseof travelling, saying: (in case you are campaigning in the land) if you are out in the land or travelling (andthe calamity of death befall you). This verse was revealed about three men who travelled together for tradeto Historic Syria. On the way, one of them, Budayl Ibn Abi Mariyah, a client of 'Amr Ibn al-'As, who was aMuslim, died. But before he died, he requested his two companions, 'Adiyy Ibn Bida' and Tamim Ibn Aws al-Dari, who were Christians, to hand over his property to his people. They however betrayed his testament. SoAllah said to the custodians of the deceased person: (You shall empanel them both) the two Christians (afterthe prayer) of 'Asr, (and, if ye doubt) O custodian of the deceased person that they gave back less than thedeceased person had with him, (they shall be made to swear by Allah (saying): We will not take a bribe) letthem say: we will not exchange our oath for a paltry portion of this world, (even though it were (on behalfof) a near kinsman) even if the deceased person is one of our kinsmen (nor will we hide the testimony ofAllah) let them also say: we will not withhold our testimony, if asked, (for then) for if we withhold ourtestimony (indeed we should be of the sinful) i.e. of the wrong-doers.
5|107|However, it became clear after their testimony that they had betrayed the dead person, and the custodiansof the deceased found out. Allah said: (But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit (thesuspicion of) sin) of betrayal, (let two others) representing the deceased person, 'Amr Ibn al-'As andMuttalib Ibn Abi Wada'ah (take their place) the place of the two Christians (of those nearly concerned) aboutsuch a betrayal, i.e. the two Christians, and it is said that the reference here is to those from whom theproperty was taken away, i.e. the custodians of the deceased person, (and let them) the custodians of thedeceased person (swear by Allah) that the property that was with the deceased person was more than whatthe two Christians gave back, ((saying): Verily our testimony) the testimony of the Muslims (is truer thantheir testimony) the testimony of the Christians (and we have not transgressed) let them say: we have nottransgressed in our claim, (for then) for if we have transgressed (indeed we should be of the evil-doers) liarswho harm others.
5|108|(Thus it is more likely) it is more appropriate and worthier (that they) the Christians (will hear true witnessor fear) i.e. the Christians (that after their oath the oath (of others) will be taken) i.e. the oath of theMuslims will be taken, so let them not withhold their testimony. (So be mindful of your duty (to Allah)) fearAllah regarding that which is entrusted to you (and hearken) to that with which you are commanded andobey Allah. (Allah guideth not the froward folk) He does not guide to His religion or clear proof lying,transgressing disbelievers nor does He guide those who are not fit for His guidance.
5|109|(In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers) this is on the Day of Judgement, (and saith) insome place, at the time of bedazzlement: (What was your response (from mankind)) how did peoplerespond to you? (They say) due to the intensity of the situation, which is that place: (We have noknowledge. Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden) i.e. that which is hidden from us of theresponse of people. But later, they answer and testify that they have delivered the message to their people.
5|110|(When Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary!

5|112|(When the disciples) the chosen among them, Simon the Pure (said: O Jesus, son of Mary!) your people areasking: (Is thy Lord able) would your Lord; and it is also said that this means: could you pray to your Lord(to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said:) Jesus said to Simon: tell them(Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah, (if ye are true believers) if you have firm faith, for it may happenthat you would not give gratitude for it and, as a result, be punished. And so Simon conveyed the messageto them.
5|113|(They said: We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts) regarding the marvels that you show us(and know) and have certainty (that thou hast spoken truth to us) regarding all what you said, (and thatthereof we may be witnesses) when we go back to our people.
5|114|(Jesus, son of Mary, said: O Allah, Lord of us! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven) it isalso said that this means: send down for us the grace of food, for they already had some food with them,(that it may be a feast for Us, for the first of us) the people of our own time (and for the last of us) thosewho come after us, so that we worship you on this day, which happened to be a Sunday, (and a sign fromYou) for he who believes and an argument against he who disbelieves. (Give us sustenance) give us thatwhich we have asked for, (for Thou art the Best of Sustainers) the Best of those who feed others.
5|115|(Allah said) to Jesus, tell them: (Lo! I send it down for you) that which you have asked for. (And whosodisbelieveth of you afterward) after sending it down and eating from it, (him surely will I punish with apunishment wherewith I have not punished any of (My) creatures) of his time: I will turn them into swine.But after they ate from the food, they said: this is clear magic. Jesus said in response: O Allah! If you punishthem for what they are saying, they are Your servants; but if you forgive them, You are Mighty in Yourretribution towards him who does not repent.
5|116|(And when Allah saith) Allah says on the Day of Judgement: (O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say untomankind) in the life of this world: (Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah? He) Jesus (saith: Beglorified! It was not mine) it was not proper nor was it permissible (to utter that to which I had no right. If Iused to say it) to them, (then Thou knewest it. Thou knowest what is in my mind) you know that which Ihave conveyed to them of commands and prohibitions, (and I know not what is in Thy mind) I do not knowwhat proceeded from you to them in terms of forsakenness or success. (Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knowerof Things Hidden) things hidden from the servants.
5|117|(I spake unto them) in the life of this world (only that which Thou commandedst me, (saying): WorshipAllah) declare Allah's divine Oneness and obey Him, (my Lord and your Lord) He is my Lord and yours.

(And be not thou (O Muhammad) of the idolaters) with theidolaters, following their religion.
6|15|(Say) O Muhammad: (I fear) I know, (if I rebel against my Lord) and worship other than Him, I would bereverting back to your religion, (the retribution of an Awful Day) I would face then a tremendous torment onan Awful Day; it is also said that this means: I would be facing torment on an Awful Day.
6|16|(He from whom) such retribution (is averted on that day) the Day of Judgement ((Allah) hath in truth hadmercy on him) He had preserved and forgiven him. (That) forgiveness (will be the signal triumph) a greatsalvation.
6|17|(If Allah touch thee with) if Allah brings on you (affliction) hardship and penury, (there is none that canrelieve therefrom) none can lift them from you (save Him, and if He touch thee with) if Allah brings on you(good fortune) blessing and wealth ((there is none that can impair it); for He is Able to do all things):hardship and penury, blessing and wealth.
6|18|(He is the Omnipotent) the All-Conquering (over His slaves, and He is the Wise) in His command and decree,(the Knower) of His created beings and their works.
6|19|When they said to the Prophet (pbuh) bring us a witness to testify that you are a prophet, Allah said: (Say)to them, O Muhammad: (What thing is of most weight) that is, fairer and most pleasing (in testimony?) Ifthey answer, fine, if not (Say: Allah is witness between you and me) that I am His Messenger and thisQur'an is His speech. (And this Qur'an hath been inspired in me) and that Gabriel has brought down thisQur'an to me, (that I may warn therewith you) with the Qur'an (and whomsoever it may reach) I am awarner to him. (Do ye) O people of Mecca (in sooth bear witness that there are gods beside Allah) i.e. idols:you say that they are Allah's daughters? And if they bear witness, (Say: I bear no such witness) with you.(Say) O Muhammad: (He is only One God) the true God is only One God. (Lo! I am innocent of that whichyou associate (with Him)) of idols in worship.
6|20|(Those unto whom We gave the Scripture) those unto who We gave the knowledge of the Torah, i.e.'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (recognise (him)) Muhammad through his traits and description (asthey recognise their sons. Those who ruin their own souls) through losing this world and the Next, i.e. Ka'bIbn al-Ashraf and his followers (will not believe) in Muhammad or the Qur'an.
6|21|(Who doth greater wrong) and is more daring (than he who inventeth a lie against Allah) by associating withHim other gods (and denieth His revelations) Muhammad and the Qur'an? (Lo! the wrong-doers) thedisbelievers and idolaters (will not be successful) will not escape or be safe from Allah's torment.
6|22|(And on the Day We gather them together) all mankind on the Day of Judgement (We shall say unto thosewho ascribed partners (unto Allah): Where are (now) those partners) idols (of your make-believe) that youworshipped and claimed they would intercede for you?
6|23|(Then will they have no contention) excuse or answer (save that they will say: By Allah, our Lord, we neverwere idolaters).
6|24|(See) O Muhammad; and it is also said the address here is to the angels (how they lie against themselves)how they have prescribed upon themselves the punishment of their lies, (and (how) the thing which theydevised) how what they falsely worshipped; it is also said that this means: how what they invented hasbecome void (hath failed them!) in that they are busy with their own plight.
6|25|(Of them are some who listen unto you) Allah says: of the people of Mecca there are some who listen toyour speech and words, among them Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughira, al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith,'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf, and al-Harth Ibn 'Amir, (but We have placedupon their hearts veils) a cover, (lest they should understand) so that they do not understand your speechor words, (and in their ears a deafness) so that they do not hear the Truth and guidance; it is also said thismeans: We have placed a heaviness in their ears so that they cannot comprehend the guidance. (If theysaw every token) they have asked you to produce (they would not believe therein) this was asked by al-Harth Ibn 'Amir; (to the point that, when they come unto thee to argue with thee) asking you about whatwas revealed in the Qur'an, and when you informed them, (the disbelievers) i.e. al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith (say:This) what Muhammad says (is naught else than fables of the men of old) the lies and stories of people ofold.
6|26|(And they) Abu Jahl and his folk (forbid (men) from it) from Muhammad and the Qur'an (and avoid it)prevent people from it and steer away from it; it is also said that this relates to Abu Talib [the Prophet'suncle] who used to warn against harming the Prophet (pbuh) even though he did not accept his message,(and they ruin none save themselves, though they perceive not) they do not realise that they carry the samesins of the men they are warning.
6|27|(If thou couldst see) O Muhammad (when they are set before) locked up in (the Fire and say: Oh, wouldthat we might return!) to the world (Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord) i.e. in theScriptures and messengers (but we would be of the believers!) with the believers inwardly and outwardly.
6|28|(Nay, but that) their punishment (hath become clear unto them which before) in the life of this world (theyused to hide) their disbelief and idolatry. (And if they were sent back) to the life of this world, as theyrequest (they would return unto that which they are forbidden) their disbelief and idolatry. (Lo! they areliars) because were they to be returned, they would still not believe.
6|29|(And they say) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca: (There is naught save our life of the world, and we shall not beraised (again)) after we die.
6|30|(If thou couldst see) O Muhammad (when they are set before) constrained before (their Lord! He will say)Allah says to them; it is also said that this means: the angels say to them: (Is not this real?) Is not thistorment and resurrection after death real? (They will say: Yea, verily, by our Lord!) It is the Truth asinformed by the messengers (He will say: Taste now the retribution for that ye used to disbelieve) in yourresurrection after death.
6|31|(They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with Allah) i.e. deny their resurrection after death; Allahsays: leave them (until, when the Hour cometh on them suddenly, they cry: Alas for us) how great is oursadness, and how sorry we are, (that we neglected it!) that we neglected faith and repentance in ourworldly life. (They bear upon their back their burdens) their sins. (Ah, evil is that which they bear) of sins!
6|32|(Naught is the life of the world) the comfort and enjoyment of the life of the world is nothing (save apastime) amusement (and a sport) worthless activity. (Better far is the abode of the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise(for those who keep their duty (to Allah)) for those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies. (Haveye then no sense?) Do you not comprehend that this world is evanescent and that the Hereafter iseverlasting?
6|33|(We know well how their talk) their slander, denial and demand for proofs (grieveth thee) O Muhammad,(though in truth they) i.e. al-Harth Ibn 'Amir and his followers (deny not thee (Muhammad)) inwardly (butevil-doers) the idolaters (flout the revelations of Allah) quite openly.
6|34|(Messengers indeed have been denied before thee) their people denied them as your people deny you now,(and they were patient under the denial) of their own people (and the persecution) and they were patient inthe face of their people's harm (till Our succour reached them) through the destruction of their people.(There is none to alter the decisions of Allah) in that He helps His friends against His enemies. (Alreadythere hath reached thee) O Muhammad ((somewhat) of the tidings of the messengers (We sent before))how their people denied them, as your people deny you now, and how they were patient.

6|36|(Only those can accept) believe and obey (who hear) who give their assent; it is also said: those whocomprehend admonition. (As for the dead) the dead of the Battle Badr, Uhud, and the Battle of theConfederates; it is also said that this means: the dead of heart, (Allah will raise them up) after death; (thenunto Him they will be returned) in the place of mustering and He will reward them for their works.
6|37|(They say) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca: al-Harth Ibn 'Amir and his folk: Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibnal-Mughira, Umayyah and Ubayy the sons of Khalaf: (Why hath no portent been sent down upon him fromhis Lord) to prove his prophethood? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Lo! Allah is Able to send down a portent)as they have asked. (But most of them know not) they have no knowledge of it being sent.
6|38|(There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two wings) between the earth and sky,(but they are peoples) creations and servants (like unto you) they resemble you in eating, copulation,understanding one another, just as you understand one another: this is a sign for you. (We have neglectednothing in the Book) We have neglected nothing that We have inscribed in the Preserved Tablet; We havementioned everything in the Qur'an. (Then unto their Lord they) the birds and beasts (will be gathered) withall other created beings on the Day of Judgement.
6|39|(Those who deny our revelations) i.e. deny Muhammad and the Qur'an (are deaf) of heart; it is also saidthat this means: they pretend not to hear the Truth (and dumb) they pretend to be dumb in relation to theTruth and guidance (in darkness) i.e. they adhere to disbelief. (Whom Allah will He sendeth astray) Hemakes him die in a state of disbelief, (and whom He will) He makes him die such that (He placeth on astraight path) places on the straight path which He is pleased with; it is also said that this means: Allahforsakes whom He will and guides, gives success and firmness in adhering to the straight path (Islam),which He is pleased with, to whom He will.
6|40|(Say: Can ye see yourselves) what you are saying, O people of Mecca, (if the punishment of Allah comeupon you) such was the case on the Day of Badr, Uhud or the Confederates (or the Hour come upon you) orif torment comes upon you on the Day of Judgement, (calling upon other than Allah? Do ye then call (forhelp) to any other than Allah) to lift the torment from you? ((Answer that) if ye are truthful) that the idolsare His partners.
6|41|(Nay, but unto Him ye call) meaning that they will not call anyone except Allah to lift the torment from them,(and He removeth that because of which you call unto Him, if He will, and you forget) you leave (whateverpartners ye ascribed unto Him) you leave the idols and do not call unto them.
6|42|(We have sent already unto peoples that were before you) just as We have sent you to your people, (andWe visited them with tribulation) fear from one another, affliction and hardship, when they did not believe(and adversity) illness, pain and hunger, (in order that they might grow humble) in order that they maybelieve and pray that I lift the punishment from them.
6|43|(If only, when our disaster) punishment (came on them, they had been humble) they had believed! (Buttheir hearts were hardened) their hearts dried up (and the devil made all that they used to do) in theirdisbelief that such is the state of life: hardship alternates with ease and comfort (seem fair unto them!)
6|44|(Then, when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded) when they turned their backs on that whichthey had been commanded with in the Scripture, (We opened unto them the gates of all things) vegetation,land fertility and comfort (till, even as they were rejoicing in that which they were given) vegetation, landfertility and comfort, (We seized them unawares) with punishment, (and lo! they were dumbfounded)despairing of any good.
6|45|(So of the people who did wrong) who ascribed partners to Allah, they were exterminated throughpunishment (the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah) say praise and thanks be to Allah, (Lord of theWorlds!) for their extermination.
6|46|(Say: Have ye imagined) what you are saying, O people of Mecca, (if Allah should take away your hearing)such that you do not hear any admonition or guidance (and your sight) such that you do not see the Truth(and seal your hearts) such that you do not perceive the Truth or guidance, (who is the God) referring hereto the idols (who could restore it to you) that which Allah has taken away from you (save Allah? See) OMuhammad (how We display the revelations unto them) how We explain the Qur'an to them? (Yet still theyturn away) they deny the revelations.
6|47|(Say: Can ye see yourselves) O people of Mecca, (if the punishment of Allah come upon you unawares)suddenly (or openly? Would any perish) through such a punishment (save wrong-doing folk?) who disobeythat with which they have been commanded; it is also said that this refers to the idolaters.
6|48|(We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news) of Paradise for whoever believes (andwarners) of the Fire for whoever disbelieves. (Whoso believeth) in the messengers and Scriptures (anddoeth right) regarding that which is between him and his Lord, (there shall no fear come upon them) whenfear comes upon the folk of hell (neither shall they grieve) when the people of hell grieve.
6|49|(But as for those who deny Our revelations) those who deny Muhammad and the Qur'an, (torment will afflictthem for that they used to disobey) because of their denial of Muhammad and the Qur'an.
6|50|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (I say not unto you (that) I possess) the keys to (the treasuresof Allah): vegetations, fruits, rain or punishment, (nor that I have knowledge of the Unseen) whenpunishment is inflicted; (and I say not unto you: Lo! I am an angel) from heaven. (I follow) I do and say(only that which is inspired in me) only that which I am commanded with in the Qur'an. (Say) OMuhammad: (Are the blind man and the seer equal?) Are the believer and disbeliever equal in acts ofobedience and reward? (Will ye not then take thought) about the similes of the Qur'an? This verse wasrevealed about Abu Jahl and his companions al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and 'Uyaynah, and then it was revealedabout the clients.
6|51|(Warn hereby) warn by the Qur'an; it is also said that this means: warn by Allah (those who fear) those whoknow and have certainty, among them Bilal Ibn Rabah, Suhayb Ibn Sinan, Mihja' Ibn Salih, 'Ammar IbnYasir, Salman al-Farisi, 'Amir Ibn Fuhayrah, Khabbab Ibn al-Aratt and Salim, the client of Abu Hudhayfah,(that they will be gathered unto their Lord) after death, (for whom there is no protecting friend) to protectthem (nor intercessor beside Him) to interceded for them or save them from the torment, (that they mayward off (evil)) ward off transgressions, and this will help them perform works of obedience.
6|52|(Repel not) O Muhammad, because of what 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari has said-he said: "repel these fromyou so that the nobles of Mecca come to you, hear you and believe in you"-and these nobles also asked'Umar to request the Prophet (pbuh) to allocate one day for them and another for weak believers, but Allahrejected this and warned them against such a deed, (those who call upon their Lord) Salman and his fellowbelievers, among the clients, who worship their Lord (at morn and evening) through performing the fivedaily prayers, (seeking His Countenance) and by doing so they only seek Allah's Countenance and goodpleasure. (Thou art not accountable for them) for their provision (in aught, nor are they accountable foryou) for your provision (in aught, that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrong-doers) of those whoharm themselves.
6|53|(And even so) thus (do We try) test (some of them by others) the Arab by the client and the noble by thelowly person. This was revealed about 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari, 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah,Umayyah Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi, Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, Suhayl Ibn'Amr and their likes among the leaders of the Quraysh who were tested by the clients, (that they) i.e.'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari and his lot (say: Are these) i.e. Salman and his fellow believers (they whomAllah favoureth) with faith (among us? Is not Allah best aware of the thanksgivers) of the believers, thosewho deserve such favour?
6|54|(And when those who believe in Our revelations) in our Book and Messenger; the reference here is to 'UmarIbn al-Khattab (come unto thee, say) O Muhammad: (Peace be unto you!) Allah has accepted yourrepentance and excuse (Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy) for anyone who repents, (that whosoof you doeth evil) sins (through ignorance) intentionally even though he did not know its due punishment(and repenteth afterward thereof) and repents of this sin (and doeth right) in relation to that which isbetween him and his Lord, ((for him) lo! Allah is Forgiving) He overlooks sins, (Merciful) towards him whorepents.
6|55|(Thus do We expound the revelations) We expound the Qur'an, explaining commands, prohibitions as wellas their events (that the way of the unrighteous may be manifest) the way of the idolaters, 'Uyaynah and hisfolk, why it is that they do not believe?
6|56|(Say) O Muhammad to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (I am forbidden) in the Qur'an (to worship those on whom youcall) you worship (instead of Allah) i.e. idols. (Say) O Muhammad to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (I will not followyour desires) by worshipping idols and repelling Salman and his fellow believers from me, (for then) for if Ido that (should I go astray) from guidance (and I should not be of the rightly guided) to that which is right ifI were to do so.
6|57|(Say) O Muhammad to al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his folk: (I am (relying) on clear proof from my Lord) and Ihave full insight of my matter and religion, (while you deny Him) you deny the Qur'an and Allah's divineOneness. (I have not that for which ye are impatient) i.e. your punishment. (The decision) to send apunishment on you (is for Allah only. He telleth the Truth) His judgement is just and He commands only thatwhich is right (and He is the Best of Deciders) the best of Judges.
6|58|(Say) O Muhammad: (If I had that for which ye are impatient) i.e. punishment, (then would the case (erethis) have been decided between me and you) you would have already been destroyed. (Allah is best awareof the wrong-doers) of the punishment of the idolaters: al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his folk. Then, thepunishment for which al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith asked happened: he was killed in captivity on the Day of Badr.
6|59|(And with Him are the keys of the invisible) the stores of the unseen: rain, vegetation, fruits, and thedescent of punishment you asked for on the Day of Badr. (None but He knoweth them) no one knows thekeys of the unseen: when the punishment for which you are impatient will come down on you. (And Heknoweth what is in the land and the sea) of created beings and marvels; it is also said that this means: Allahknows what He destroys in the land and in the sea. (Not a leaf falleth) from a tree (but He knoweth it) Heknows how many times it spins in the air before it falls, (not a grain amid the darkness of the earth) under arock at the bottom of the earth except that He knows it, (naught of wet) i.e. water (or dry) steppe (but (it isnoted) in a) written (clear record) all of it is in the Guarded Tablet: with their precise measure and time.
6|60|(He it is Who gathereth you at night) He takes your souls away in your sleep (and knoweth that which yecommit) you earn (by day. Then He raiseth you again to life) He returns to you again your souls (therein) inthe day, (that the term appointed (for you) may be accomplished) that your lifespan and provisions reachtheir terms. (And afterward unto Him is your return) after you die. (Then He will proclaim unto you what yeused to do) of good and evil.
6|61|(He is the Omnipotent) the All-Conquering (over His slaves. He sendeth guardians) angels: two angelsduring the day and two at night; they record your good and bad deeds (over you until, when death comethunto one of you, Our messengers) i.e. the angel of death and his assistants (receive him, and they neglectnot) they do not delay the time of death by even a fraction of a second.
6|62|(Then are they restored unto Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (their Lord, the Just) Who is in charge of theirright and just reward and punishment; it is also said (their Lord, the Just) means: their true God whom theyought to have worshipped, but they did not worship Him truly as He ought to have been worshipped.However, objects of worship other than Allah are void. (Surely His is the judgement) between people on theDay of Judgement. (And He is the most swift of reckoners) when He takes people to task, He does soswiftly.
6|63|(Say) O Muhammad to the disbelievers of Mecca: (Who delivereth you from the darkness) from thehardships and tumults (of the land and the sea? Ye call upon Him humbly and in secret) openly and insecret, ((saying): If we are delivered from this) from these hardships and tumults (we truly will be of thethankful) of the believers.
6|64|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Allah delivereth you from this) from the hardships of the sea and the land(and from all afflictions) from all grief and turmoil. (Yet ye) people of Mecca (attribute partners) idols (untoHim).
6|65|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (He is able to send punishment upon you from above you) as He did on thepeople of Noah and the people of Lot (or from beneath your feet) or make the earth swallow you as itswallowed Korah, (or to bewilder you with dissension) make divide into conflicting sects as He did with theChildren of Israel after the prophets (and make you taste the tyranny) the sword of (one of another. See) OMuhammad (how We display the revelations) how We expound in the Qur'an the events of past nations andthat which We did with them (so that they may understand) so that they may understand Allah's commandsand His divine Oneness.
6|66|(Your people) the Quraysh ((O Muhammad) have denied it) the Qur'an, (though it) the Qur'an (is the Truth.Say) O Muhammad: (I am not put in charge of you) I do not guarantee to take you to Allah as believers.
6|67|(For every announcement there is a term) for every saying from Allah, and for every command, prohibition,promise, threat, glad tiding of victory or punishment that you receive from Me, there is a term-it is an actand fact from Him, some of which will happen in this world and some in the Hereafter, (and ye will come toknow) of all of it in this world or in the Hereafter; it is also said that (For every announcement there is aterm) means: every action and speech reflects a true meaning that is in your hearts, and you shall see whatwill be done with you.
6|68|(And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations) those who mock you and mock the Qur'an,(withdraw from them) leave their assembly (until they meddle with another topic) such that they talk aboutsomething other than the Qur'an and such that they cease mocking you. (And if the devil cause thee toforget) after being warned against it, (sit not, after the remembrance) after being reminded, (with thecongregation of wrong-doers) the idolaters. Allah commanded His Prophet with this in Mecca, but theprophetic Companions found it hard to implement. They were later given dispensation to sit with theidolaters so as to admonish and warn them.
6|69|(Those who ward off (evil)) those who ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies and mockery (are notaccountable for them) for their sins, disbelief and mockery towards the believers (in aught, but theReminder) by means of the Qur'an ((must be given them) that haply they (too) may ward off (evil))disbelief, idolatry, indecencies and mocking the Qur'an and Muhammad (pbuh).
6|70|(And forsake those who take their religion) the Jews, Christians, and the Arab polytheists who took thereligion of their forefathers (for a pastime) a joke (and a jest) a mockery; it is also said that this means:religion for them is a merriness and fiction (and whom the life of the world beguileth) the comfort andbounties of the world beguiled them. (Remind (mankind) hereby) admonish through the Qur'an; it is alsosaid this means: admonish by Allah (lest a soul be destroyed) be weakened and punished (by what itearneth) of sins. (It) the soul (hath beside Allah) against Allah's punishment (no friend) no close friend todefend it (nor intercessor) to intercede for it, (and though it offer every compensation) even if it brings allthat which is on the face of the earth to compensate for it (it will not be accepted from it. Those) who mock(are they who perish) to be humiliated and punished; these are 'Uyaynah, al-Nadr and their folk, (by theirown deserts) because of their own sins. (For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom, becausethey disbelieved) in Muhammad and the Qur'an.
6|71|(Say) O Muhammad, to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (Shall we cry) do you ask us to worship (instead of untoAllah, unto that which neither profiteth us) if we worshipped it, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter (norhurteth us) if we did not worship it, neither in this world nor in the Next, (and shall we turn back) to idolatry(after Allah hath guided us) has honoured us with His religion, (like) if we were to do so, we would be like(one bewildered) erred from guidance (whom the devils have infatuated) lured down (in the earth, who hathcompanions) 'Uyaynah has friends, the prophetic Companions (who invite him to the guidance) to Islam((saying): Come unto us) obey us? While 'Uyaynah was inviting them to idolatry. It is also said that thisverse was revealed about Abu Bakr and his son 'Abd al-Rahman. Prior to embracing Islam, 'Abd al-Rahmanused to invite his parents to his religion. Allah said to his Prophet: tell Abu Bakr to say to his son 'Abd al-Rahman: are you asking us O 'Abd al-Rahman, to worship, instead of Allah, that which does not benefit us inthis world in our provision or livelihood or in the Hereafter if we were to worship it, nor hurt us, if we did notworship it? Are you really asking us to return to our old religion after Allah has guided us to the religion ofMuhammad (pbuh). If we were to do as you ask us, we would be like 'Abd al-Rahman who erred and whomthe devils lured away from Allah's religion. The parents of 'Abd al-Rahman-Abu Bakr and his wife-invited himto Islam and repentance, while he invited them to idolatry. His parents say to him: obey us and embraceIslam. (Say) O Muhammad: (Lo! the guidance of Allah is Guidance) the religion of Allah is Islam and ourQiblah is the Ka'bah, (and we are ordered to surrender) to make our worship and confession of Allah's divineOneness sincere (to the Lord of the Worlds) to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,
6|72|(And to establish worship) the five daily prayers (and ward off (evil)) obey Allah, (and He it is unto Whom yewill be gathered) after you die and will reward you for your works.
6|73|(He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth) to expound the Truth and expose falsehood; it isalso said that this means: to show that they are ephemeral and evanescent. (In that day when He saith) tothe wall: (Be! it is) i.e. the heavens will become a wall which will be blown into, like one blows into a horn.Then the heaven will be changed into a different heaven; it is also said that (Be! it is) means: when He saysto the Day of Judgement: "Be", and it will be. (His word) regarding the resurrection (is the Truth, and Hiswill be the Sovereignty) the judgement between the servants (on the Day when the trumpet is blown.Knower of the invisible) that which will happen in the future (and the visible) that which has alreadyhappened; it is also said that the 'invisible' refers to that which is unseen by people while 'the visible' refersto that which Allah's servants see, (He is the Wise) in His command and decree, (the Aware) of His createdbeings and of their works.
6|74|((Remember) when Abraham said unto his father Azar) who was Terah the son of Nahur: (Takest thou idols)do you worship idols (for gods) so many gods: small and large, male and female? (Lo! I see thee) O myfather (and thy folk in error manifest) in manifest disbelief and wrong in so worshipping idols.
6|75|(Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth) that which is between the heavensand the earth: the sun, the moon and the stars when he came out of the hole into which he was thrown(that he might be of those possessing certainty) that he might be of those who acknowledge that Allah isOne, the Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that which is in them; it is also said that Allah showedhim this on the night He made him ascend to heaven. He saw up to the seventh heaven and the seventhearth, so that he may have the certitude of inspiration:
6|76|(When the night grew dark upon him) in the hole (he beheld a star) the planet Venus. (He said: This is myLord) could this be my Lord? (But when it set) when its colour changed to red and it disappeared, (he said: Ilove not things that set) I do not love a lord that is not lasting.
6|77|(And when he saw the moon uprising, he exclaimed: This my Lord) could this be my Lord? This is biggerthan the first one. (But when it set, he said: Unless my Lord guide me) unless my Lord makes me firm onguidance, (I surely shall become one of the folk who are astray) from guidance.
6|78|(And when he saw the sun uprising) filling everything [with its light], (he cried: This is my Lord!) Could thisbe my Lord? (This is greater!) This is bigger than the first and the second. (And when it set) when itdisappeared, Abraham said: I do not love a lord who is not lasting. If Allah does not guide me, I shall be ofthose who err. It is also said that Abraham said 'this is my Lord' mocking his people, for his peopleworshipped the sun, the moon and the stars. He therefore objected to such worship by mocking them,saying to them: could the like of these be a Lord? When he emerged from the hole and went to his people-he was then 17 years old-he looked at the sky and the earth and then said: my Lord is Him Who has createdthis. He then proceeded until he found a group of his people attending with devotion to their idols, (heexclaimed: O my people! Lo! I am free from all that ye associate (with Him)) of idols.
6|79|When they asked him: who do you worship? He said: (Lo! I have turned my face towards) I have made myreligion and works sincere to (him Who created the heavens and the earth, as one by nature upright)Muslim, (and I am not of the idolaters) who follows their religion.
6|80|(His people argued with him) regarding their gods and threatened him by them so that he would leave thereligion of Allah. (He) Abraham (said: Dispute ye with me concerning Allah) do you argue with me in favourof your gods and threaten me so that I might leave the religion of my Lord (when He hath guided me) to Hisreligion? (I fear not at all that which ye set beside Him) i.e. idols (unless my Lord willeth aught) to takeaway the knowledge from my heart such that I fear what you do. (My Lord includeth all things in Hisknowledge) my Lord knows that you do not follow the Truth: (Will ye not then remember) take admonitionfrom the warning I am telling you about?
6|81|(How should I fear that which ye set up beside Him) of idols, (when ye fear not) Allah (to set up besideAllah that for which He hath revealed unto you no warrant) no Scripture or proof? They threatened him withtheir gods, saying: we fear that if you vilify our gods, they will take away your sanity. (Which of the twofactions) which of the adherents of the two religions: you or I (hath more right to safety) from the GodWhom he worships? ((Answer me that) if ye have knowledge) of this.
6|82|When they did not answer what Abraham asked them, He said: (Those who believe and obscure not theirbelief by wrong-doing) have not mixed their belief with idolatry, and are not hypocrites, (theirs is safety)from their Lord; (and they are rightly guided) to that which is right; it is also said that this means: thosethey are who have safety from punishment and are guided to the proof [of faith].
6|83|(That is Our argument. We gave it) We inspired it (unto Abraham against his folk. We raise unto degrees)merits, by bestowing upon him power, status, argument and the knowledge of Allah's divine Oneness (ofwisdom whom We will) whoever is fit for it. (Lo! thy Lord is Wise) in inspiring His friend with cleararguments, (Aware) of the argument of His friends and of the punishment of His enemies.
6|84|(And We bestowed upon him) upon Abraham (Isaac) as a son (and Jacob) as a grandson; (each of them)i.e. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (We guided) We honoured by bestowing upon them prophethood and Islam(surrender to Allah); (and Noah did We guide) We honoured him by bestowing upon him prophethood andIslam (aforetime) i.e. before Abraham; (and of his seed) of the seed of Noah; it is also said that this means:of the seed of Abraham ((We guided) David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron) Weguided all of them by bestowing upon them prophethood and Islam. (Thus do We reward the good) in theirworks and speech; it is also said that this means: those who confess Allah's divine Oneness.
6|85|(And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias. Each one (of them)) We guided by bestowing upon themprophethood and Islam; and all of them were of the seed of Abraham (was of the righteous) i.e. they weremessengers.
6|86|(And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. Each one of them) all these prophets (did We prefer) by meansof prophethood and Islam (above (Our) creatures) above the people of their own time, both believers andunbelievers.
6|87|(With some of their forefathers) Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Hud, and Salih: We guided all of them bybestowing prophethood and Islam upon them, (and their offspring) i.e. the offspring of Jacob (and theirbrethren) i.e. the brothers of Joseph: We guided them all to prophethood and Islam; (and We chose themand guided them unto a straight path) i.e. We made them firm on a straight path:
6|88|(Such) the straight path (is the guidance of Allah) the religion of Allah (wherewith He guideth whom He will)whoever is fit for it (of His bondmen. But if they had set up (for worship) aught beside Him) had theseprophets associated anyone or anything with Allah, ((all) that they did) of works (would have been vain).
6|89|(Those are they) We told you about of the prophets (unto whom We gave the Scripture) which Gabrielbrought down from heaven (and command) knowledge and understanding (and prophethood. But if these)the people of Mecca (disbelieve therein) in their way and religion, (then indeed We shall entrust it to) Wehave given success to follow the way and religion of the prophets to (a people) in Medina (who will not bedisbelievers therein) in the way and religion of the prophets.
6|90|(Those) prophets whom We have told you about (are they whom Allah guideth) to the most noble ofcharacter traits, (so follow their guidance) follow their most noble character, such as patience, endurance,good will, contentment, and other similar traits. (Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (I ask of youno fee) no wage (for it) for Allah's divine Oneness or for the Qur'an. (Lo! It) the Qur'an (is naught but aReminder) an admonition (to (His) creatures) the jinn and human beings.
6|91|(And they measure not the power of Allah its true measure) they do not glorify Allah as He should beglorified (when they say: Allah hath naught) no Scripture (revealed unto a human being) among theprophets. This verse was revealed about Malik Ibn al-Sayf, the Jew, who claimed that Allah did not revealany Scripture to human beings. (Say) O Muhammad, to Malik: (Who revealed the Book which Mosesbrought, a light) an exposition and enlightenment (and guidance for mankind) from error, (which ye haveput) written (on parchments which ye show) many things which do not contain the traits and description ofthe Prophet (pbuh) (but ye hide much (thereof)) you hide many portions of it which contain the traits anddescription of Muhammad (pbuh) (and by which ye were taught) of legal rulings, punishment, the lawful andthe unlawful as well as the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Scripture (that which ye knewnot yourselves nor (did) your fathers (know it)) before the revelation of legal rulings and punishments? Ifthey answer and say it was Allah, then fine, if they do not, (Say: Allah) revealed it. (Then leave them to theirplay of cavilling) let them indulge in their falsehood: quibbling and lying.
6|92|(And this) i.e. the Qur'an (is a blessed Scripture) contains mercy and forgiveness for him who believes in it(which We have revealed) which Gabriel brought down, (confirming that which (was revealed) before it)agreeing with the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms and with all earlier Scriptures as regard Allah's divineOneness and the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (that thou mayst warn) by means of theQur'an (the Mother of Villages) i.e. the people of Mecca; it is also said that (the Mother of Villages) means:the largest of villages; it is also said that it was called (the Mother of Villages) because the earth waslevelled from beneath it (and those around her) of the rest of lands. (Those who believe in the Hereafter)those who believe in resurrection after death and in the bliss of Paradise (believe herein) believe inMuhammad and the Qur'an, (and they are careful of their worship) and they observe the appointed time forthe five daily prayers.
6|93|(Who is guilty) who is more tyrannical and more daring (of more wrong than he who forgeth a lie againstAllah, or saith) Allah did not reveal anything, this is Malik Ibn al-Sayf, or him who says: (I am inspired) witha Scripture, (when he is not inspired in aught) with any Scripture, this is Musaylimah, the liar; (and whosaith: I will reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed) I will say the like of what Muhammad (pbuh) issaying: this is 'Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh. (If thou couldst see) O Muhammad, (when the wrong-doers)the idolaters and the hypocrites, on the Day of Badr (reach the pangs of death and the angels stretch theirhands out) to take out their souls, (saying: Deliver up your souls) your spirits. (This day) the Day of Badr, asit is said it is the Day of Judgement (ye are awarded doom of degradation) a severe doom (for that ye spakeconcerning Allah other than the Truth, and scorned) you thought yourselves too great to believe inMuhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (His portents) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an.
6|94|(Now have ye come unto Us solitary) with nothing: no wealth and no offspring (as We did create you at thefirst) in the world, without wealth or offspring, (and ye have left behind you) in the worldly life (all that Webestowed upon you, and We behold not with you those your intercessors) your gods, (of whom ye claimedthat they possessed a share in you) they were your intercessors. (Now is the bond) the connection and love(between you severed, and that which ye presumed) you worshipped and say that they are yourintercessors, i.e. idols (hath failed you) for they are occupied with their own selves.
6|95|(Lo! Allah (it is) who spliteth the grain) i.e. He creates all kinds of grains; it is also said that this means: Hecreates that which is in the grains (of corn and the date-stone (for sprouting)) just as He creates all thatwhich contains stones. (He bringeth forth the living from the dead) He brings forth living creatures andbeasts from sperm drops; it is also said that this means: He creates birds from eggs; and it is said that thismeans: He creates a spike of grain and fruits from grains and stones, (and is the bringer forth of the deadfrom the living) He brings forth sperms from living creatures and beasts; it is also said that this means: Hecreates eggs from birds; and it is said that this means: He creates grains from corn and fruits. (Such) whodoes this (is Allah) and not any other god. (How then are you perverted) why then do you lie?
6|96|(He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak) He is the Creator of the morning of the day, (and He hath appointed thenight for stillness) for created beings, (and the sun and the moon) and He has created the sun and themoon (for reckoning) i.e. their phases change according to precise measures; it is also said that this means:the sun and the moon are suspended between the sky and the earth, rotating. (That is the measuring of theMighty) i.e. through the providence of the Mighty in retribution vis-�-vis whoever does not believe in him,(the Wise) in His providence and who knows those who believe in Him and those who do not.
6|97|(And He it is Who hath set for you the stars that ye may guide) that you may know (your course by themamid the darkness of the land and the sea) and their terror when you travel by land or sea.

6|98|(And He it is Who hath produced) created (you from a single being) from Adam, (and (hath given you) ahabitation) in the wombs (and a repository) in the loins; it is also said this means: He has given you ahabitation in the loins and repository in the wombs. (We have detailed Our revelations for a people whohave understanding) of Allah's command and His divine Oneness.
6|99|(He it is Who sendeth down water) rain (from the sky, and therewith We bring forth) by means of the rain(buds of every kind) of grains and other things; (We bring forth) from the earth by means of the rain (thegreen blade) green vegetation (from, which) from this green vegetation (we bring forth the thick clusteredgrain) clustered in spikes of grain and in other vegetations; (and from the date-palm, from the pollenthereof, spring pendant) close by, accessible to anyone standing or sitting (bunches; and (We bring forth)Gardens of grapes, and the) trees of (olive and the pomegranate) trees, (alike) in colour, referring here topomegranates (and unlike) in taste. (Look upon the fruit thereof, when they bear fruit, and upon itsripening. Lo! Herein) in the difference of their colour (verily are portents) signs (for a people who believe)that they are from Allah.
6|100|(Yet they ascribe as partners unto Him the jinn) they said: Allah, Exalted is He, and Satan are brothers andpartners: Allah is the Creator of human beings, beasts and cattle while Satan is the Creator of snakes,scorpions and predatory beasts. This is the claim of the Magians, (although He did create them) andcommand them to declare His divine Oneness, (and impute falsely, without knowledge) without knowledge,argument or proof, (sons) as claimed by the Jews and Christians (and daughters unto Him) among theangels and idols, as claimed by the Arab idolaters. (Glorified be He) He has exonerated Himself from havingchildren or partners (and high exalted) and He absolves Himself (above (all) that they ascribe (unto Him)) ofsons and daughters.
6|101|(The Originator) the Creator (of the heavens and the earth!) He created them when they were nothingbefore such creation. (How can He have a child, when there is for Him no consort) no wife, (when Hecreated all things and is Aware of all things) of all created beings?
6|102|(Such is Allah, your Lord) He Who does so is your Lord. (There is no God save Him) alone without anypartner, (the Creator of all things, so worship Him) declare His divine Oneness and do not ascribe partnersto Him. (And He taketh care) He is witness; as it is said that this means: He is the guarantor of the provision(of all things) of all created beings.
6|103|(Vision comprehendeth Him not) in this world, nor do created beings see what He sees. Sights will notcomprehend the modality of seeing Him in the Hereafter nor will created beings be able to see Him in thisworld, (but He comprehendeth (all) vision) in this world and in the Hereafter: He sees that which humanbeings do not see and nothing escapes or is hidden from Him. (He is the Subtile) in His actions whoseknowledge surrounds His created beings, (the Aware) of His created beings and their actions.

6|105|(Thus do We display Our revelations) We expound the Qur'an regarding their matter (that they may say(unto thee, Muhammad): "Thou hast studied,") you have learnt and acquired these traits from anotherperson; it is also said that this means: in order that they do not say you acquired these traits from anotherperson; and it is also said that it could mean: so that they do not say you have learnt it from Abu Fukayhah,a client from the Quraysh, or from Jabr and Yasar, two other clients from the Quraysh; and it could alsomean: these are old stories (and that We may make (it) clear for people who have knowledge) who believeit is from Allah.
6|106|(Follow that which is inspired in you from thy Lord) act upon that which is revealed to you from your Lord,i.e. the Qur'an: what is lawful and unlawful; (there is no God save Him) there is no creator or provider saveHim; (and turn away from the idolaters) those who mock, among whom are al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi, al-'As Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi, al-Aswad Ibn 'Abd Yaghuth al-Zuhri, al-Aswad Ibn al-Harith Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, and al-Harith Ibn Qays Ibn Hanzalah.
6|107|(Had Allah willed) that they did not ascribe partners to Allah, (they had not been idolatrous). We have notset you as a keeper over them) to protect them, (nor art thou responsible for them) nor are you theircustodian.
6|108|(Revile not those unto whom they pray) worship (beside Allah lest they wrongfully revile Allah throughignorance) because they have no knowledge, argument; this after He told them: (Lo! you (idolaters) andthat which you worship beside Allah are fuel of hell) but then this was abrogated by the verse of fighting.(Thus) as We made their religion and works seem fair to them (unto every nation) to every adherents of areligion (have We made their deed) and their religion (seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return) afterthey die, (and He will tell them what they used to do) in relation to their religion.
6|109|(And they swear a solemn oath) an utmost oath, for when one swears by Allah, one swears a solemn oath(by Allah that if there come unto them a portent) as they have asked (they will believe therein) they willbelieve in that sign. (Say) O Muhammad, to those who sneer and their folk: (Portents are with Allah) thesigns come from Allah (and (so is) that which telleth you) and how do you know, O believers (that if such)the signs (came unto them they would not believe) by Allah they will not believe in the sign.
6|110|(We confound their hearts and their eyes) upon the revelation of the sign such that they do not believe in it.(As they believed not therein) just as they did not believe in that which the Prophet (pbuh) informed themabout the sign (at the first) before this, (We let them wander) We leave them (blindly on in their contumacy)in their disbelief and error.
6|111|(And though We should send down the angels) as they have asked and testified in favour of that which theydenied (unto them) unto those who sneer, (and the dead should speak unto them) from their graves, asthey asked, telling them that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger and that the Qur'an is Allah's speech, (and Weshould gather against them all things) of birds and beasts (in array) face to face, testifying that what We sayis the Truth and affirming that which they have denied, (they would not believe) in Muhammad and theQur'an (unless Allah so willed) that they believe. (Howbeit, most of them are ignorant) that it is the Truthfrom Allah.
6|112|(Thus) just as We have appointed Abu Jahl and those who sneer as your enemies, so (have We appointedunto every Prophet an adversary) a tyrant (devils of humankind and jinn) He says: We appointed humanand jinn devils (who inspire in) dictate to (one another plausible discourse through guile) in order to deceivethe son of Adam. (If thy Lord willed they would not do so) i.e. dictate plausible discourse and beguiling; (soleave them alone) leave, O Muhammad, those who sneer and their folk (with their devising) theirembellishment of words and deception;
6|113|(That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter) who do not believe in resurrection after death(may incline thereto) to such embellishment of words and deception, (and that they may take pleasuretherein) and so that they may accept from the satans such embellishment and deception, (and that theymay earn what they are earning) of sin.
6|114|Then, say to them, O Muhammad: (Shall I seek other than Allah for judge) shall I worship as Lord otherthan Allah, (when He it is who has revealed unto you) you are your prophet ((this) Scripture) this Qur'anthrough the intermediary of Gabriel, (fully explained?) explaining fully the lawful and the unlawful; it is alsosaid: it is revealed in instalments, a few verses on each occasion. (Those unto whom We gave the Scripture)those to whom We have given knowledge of the Torah, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (know)are certain on the basis of their Scripture (that it) i.e. the Qur'an (is revealed from thy Lord in truth) withcommands and prohibitions; it is also said that this means: Gabriel is sent by your Lord with the Truth, i.e.with the Qur'an. (So be not thou (O Muhammad) of the waverers) of those who doubt that they might notknow this.
6|115|(Perfected is the Word of thy Lord) the Qur'an, detailing the commands and prohibitions (in truth) in Hisspeech (and justice) from Him. (There is naught that can change His words) the Qur'an; it is also said thatthis means: the Word of your Lord has prescribed that His friends shall triumph. He is truthful in His speechand just in that which shall come. Nothing can change His words about His giving help to His friend. It isalso said that this means: the religion of your Lord is now manifest, people truthfully believe that it is Allah'sreligion. Allah's command is just and nothing will ever change His religion.

6|116|(If thou obeyedst) O Muhammad (most of those on earth) i.e. the Meccan leaders who were Abu'l-AhwasMalik Ibn 'Awf al-Jushami, Budayl Ibn Warqa' al-Khuza'i and Julays Ibn Warqa' al-Khuza'i (they wouldmislead thee far from Allah's way) in the Sacred Precinct. (They follow naught but an opinion) theypronounce nothing but surmise, (and they do but guess) they lie to the believers when they say to them:that which Allah immolates is better than that which you slaughter with your own knives.
6|117|(Lo! thy Lord, He knoweth best who erreth from His way) from His religion and obedience; (and He knowethbest (who are) the rightly guided) to His religion, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions.

6|119|(How should ye not eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned) of immolated animals,(when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you) such as the meat of carrion, blood andpork, (unless you are compelled thereto) except if you are forced to eat the meat of carrion. (But lo! Many)Abu'l-Ahwas and his folk (are led astray by their own lusts) call on you to eat the meat of carrion (throughignorance) or proof. (Lo! your Lord, He is best aware of the transgressors) who move from the lawful to thatwhich is unlawful.
6|120|(Forsake the outwardness of sin) the adultery of the outward (and the inwardness thereof) secret adultery,i.e. taking lovers in secret. (Lo! those who garner sin) those who commit adultery (will be awarded) alashing in this world and punishment in the Hereafter because of (that which they have earned) i.e.committing adultery.
6|121|(And eat not of that whereon Allah's name hath not been mentioned) of immolated animals intentionally,(for lo! it is abomination) i.e. eating it without a necessity is a sin and declaring it lawful, in denial of therevelation, is an act of disbelief. (Lo! the devils do inspire) whisper to (their minions) Abu'l-Ahwas and hisfolk (to dispute with you) regarding the consumption of the meat of carrion, idolatry and about the angelsbeing the daughters of Allah. (But if you obey them) in their idolatry and the consumption of the meat ofcarrion, declaring it lawful without being in dire need of it, (ye will be in truth idolaters) like them.
6|122|(Is he who was dead) i.e. the disbeliever; this verse was revealed about 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, Abu Jahl IbnHisham (and We have raised him unto life) and We honoured him with faith, referring to 'Ammar Ibn Yasir,(and set for him a light) knowledge (wherein he walketh) wherein he is guided (among men) it is also saidthat (and set for him a light) means: We set for him a light on the Bridge over hell in the midst of people,(as him whose similitude is in utter darkness) the error of disbelief in this world and the darkness ofGehenna on the Day of Judgement, the reference here is to Abu Jahl (whence he cannot emerge) he cannotfree himself from disbelief and error in this world nor from the darkness in the Hereafter? (Thus is theirconduct made fair-seeming for the disbelievers) thus We made his works seem fair to Abu Jahl.
6|123|(And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones) their leaders, tyrants and wealthycitizens, as We made in the city of Mecca those who sneer and their friend, Abu Jahl and his folk, (that theyshould plot therein) that they should engage in transgression and corruption; it is also said that this means:so that they deny therein the prophets. (They do but plot against themselves) He says: the punishment andruination of the transgressions and corruption they commit will be to their detriment, (though they perceivenot) this.
6|124|(And when a token cometh unto them) when a verse comes down from heaven informing of what al-WalidIbn al-Mughirah, 'Abd Yalayl and Abu Mas'ud al-Thaqafi were doing, (they say: We will not believe) in thisverse (till we are given) the Scripture like (that which Allah's messengers are given) meaning Muhammad(pbuh). (Allah knoweth best with whom to place His message) He knows best to whom He sends Gabrielwith His message. (Humiliation) degradation and abasement (from Allah and heavy punishment will smitethe guilty) the idolaters, i.e. al-Walid and his friends (for their scheming) for their denial of the messengers.
6|125|(And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide) to His religion, (He expandeth his bosom) His heart (unto theSurrender) unto accepting Islam, (and whomsoever it is His will to send astray) to leave in error anddisbelief, (He maketh his bosom) He leaves his heart (close) like the ferrule of a spear (and narrow) indoubt; this could also mean: the light cannot find a way, or a passage to his heart (as if he were engaged insheer ascent) like a person who is told to rise in heaven: the heart of such a person is not guided to Islam.(Thus Allah layeth ignominy) Allah leaves denial (upon those) in the heart of those (who believe not) inMuhammad (pbuh), or in the Qur'an, and then He punishes them for their disbelief.
6|126|(This is the path of thy Lord) this is the doing of your Lord, (a straight path) a just path; it is also said thismeans: This Islam is the religion of your Lord which He is pleased with; it is straight and well established.(We have detailed Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an, by explaining the commands and prohibitions, the causesof humiliation and the reasons for honour (for a people who take heed) for a people who understand andtherefore believe. It is also said that (And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide) was revealed about theProphet (pbuh) and Abu Jahl; it is also said to have been revealed about 'Ammar Ibn Yasir and Abu Jahl.
6|127|(For them) for the believers (is the abode of peace with their Lord) Peace (al-Salam) is Allah and His abodeis Paradise. (He be their Protecting Friend) who bestows upon them honour and reward (because of whatthey used to do) and say of goodness in the life of this world.
6|128|(In the day when He will gather them together) the jinn and human beings ((He will say): O ye assembly ofthe jinn! Many of humankind did ye seduce) how many human beings have erred by seeking help in you.(And their adherents) the adherents of the jinn (among humankind) who sought help in the leaders of thejinn upon camping at a valley or hunting a beast of theirs, used to say: 'we seek refuge in the master of thisvalley from the foolish among his people', and used to feel safe after saying this, (will say: Our Lord!) O ourLord! (We enjoyed one another) we benefited from one another; the benefit of the human beings was safetyfrom the jinn, and that of the jinn, their status and position among their people (but now we have arrived atthe appointed term which Thou appointedst for us) i.e. death. (He) Allah (will say) to them: (Fire is yourhome) is your dwelling, O group of jinn. (Abide therein for ever) abiding in the Fire, (save him whom Allahwilleth (to deliver)) but Allah wills that they abide therein for eternity. (Lo! thy Lord is Wise) He decreed thatthey will abide in hell for ever, (Aware) of them and of their punishment.
6|129|(Thus We let some of the wrong-doers) the idolaters (have power over others) in the life of this world and inthe Hereafter; it is also said that this means: We let some of the idolaters have authority over others(because of what they are wont to earn) and say of evil.
6|130|(O ye assembly of the jinn and, humankind! Came there not unto you messengers of your own) i.e. humanmessengers: Muhammad (pbuh) and all other messengers, and among the jinn, the nine who came to theProphet (pbuh) and then went back to their people to deliver the message; it is also said that the jinn had aprophet of their own called Joseph, (who recounted) recited (unto you My tokens) detailing commands andprohibitions (and warned you of the meeting) the punishment (of this your Day? They) the humans and jinn(will say: We testify against ourselves) that they delivered the message and that we disbelieved them. Allahsaid: (And the life of the world) that which is in the life of this world of comfort and enjoyment (beguiledthem. And they testify against themselves) in the Hereafter (that they were disbelievers) in the life of thisworld.
6|131|(This) i.e. sending messengers (is because your Lord destroyeth not the townships) the people of thetownships (arbitrarily) because of their idolatry or transgression; it is also said that this means: out ofinjustice (while their people are unconscious) of the commands and prohibitions and the conveyance of themessengers.
6|132|(For all) among the jinn and human beings (there will be ranks) for the believers among the jinn andhumans in Paradise, and dungeons in hell for the unbelievers (from what they did) of good or evil (Thy Lordis not unaware) oblivious (of what they do) of good or evil; it is also said that this means: He is not going tosuspend the punishment due for their transgressions.
6|133|(Thy Lord is the Absolute) free of the need for their faith, (the Lord of Mercy) in that He defers punishmentfor him who believes in Him. (If He will, He can remove you) destroy you, O people of Mecca (and can causewhat He will to follow after you, even as He raised you from the seed of other folk) generation aftergeneration.
6|134|(Lo! that which ye are promised) of torment (will surely come to pass, and ye cannot escape) such atorment, for it will reach wherever you are.
6|135|(Say) O Muhammad, to the unbelievers of Mecca: (O my people! Work according to your power) accordingto your religion in your own homes to destroy me. (Lo! I too am working) to destroy you. (Thus ye will cometo know for which of us will be the happy sequel) i.e. Paradise. (Lo! the wrong-doers) the idolaters (will notbe successful) safe nor will they escape from Allah's torment.
6|136|(They assign unto Allah) they ascribe to Allah, (of the crops and cattle) camels, oxen and the camels whichgraze freely (which He created, a portion, and they say: "This is Allah's" in their make believe "and this is for(His) partners) their gods (in regard to us". Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners) their gods (inthem reacheth not Allah) does not go to that which they have assigned to Allah (and that which (theyassign) unto Allah goeth to your (so called) partners) so called gods. (Evil is their ordinance) evil is thatwhich they decree for themselves.
6|137|(Thus) just as We have made their words and works seem fair to them (have their (so called) partners)among the devil (made the killing of their children) their daughters (to seem fair unto many of the idolaters,that they may ruin them) destroy them (and make their faith) the religion of Abraham and Ishmael (obscurefor them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so) i.e. killing their daughters and making itseem fair to them. (So leave them alone with their devices) with their lies when they claim that Allahcommanded them to bury their daughters alive.
6|138|(And they say: Such cattle) i.e. the Bahirah, al-Sa'ibah, al-Wasilah and al-Ham (and crops are forbidden. Noone is to eat of them save whom We will in their make believe) they means men to the exclusion of women(cattle whose backs are forbidden) i.e. what is known as al-Ham, (cattle over which they mention not thename of Allah) when they get pregnant or deliver, this is what is called al-Bahirah. ((All that is) a lie againstHim) i.e. that He commanded them to do so. (He will repay them for that which they invent) for lyingagainst Him.
6|139|(And they say: That which is in the bellies of such cattle) i.e. al-Bahirah and al-Wasilah (is reserved) lawful(for our males) men (and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be born dead) or dies consequently, (then they(all)) males and females (may be partakers thereof) in eating its meat. (He will reward them) this is a threatto them (for their attribution (ordinances unto Him)) it is also said that this means: He will reward them withwhat will happen to them. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) saw 'Amr ibn Luhayy, who taught them theunlawfulness of the cattle described above, dragging his guts from his behind. (Lo, He is Wise) He madethat which is lawful permitted, (Aware) of their ascription of unlawfulness to things that are lawful.
6|140|(They are losers who besottedly) out of ignorance (have slain their children) have buried their daughtersalive (without knowledge) this was revealed about Rabi'ah and Mudar, two leaders of Arab clans buried theirdaughters alive in the pre-Islamic period, except for the the Banu Kinanah who did not engage in such apractice, (and have forbidden) for women (that which Allah bestowed upon them) that which Allah hasmade lawful for them of cattle and crops, (inventing a lie against Allah. They indeed have gone astray) theyare in error about what they say (and are not guided) to the guidance and right in that which they ascribeunlawfulness.
6|141|(He it is Who produceth) creates (gardens trellised) spread out: i.e. not resting on trunks such as vines andother vegetations (and untrellised) that which rests on trunks such as walnuts and almonds, (and the date-palm, and crops of diverse flavour) sweetness and sourness, (and the olive) and He created the olive tree(and the pomegranate) of pomegranate trees, (like) in colour and appearance (and unlike) in taste. (Eat youof the fruit thereof) of the fruit of the palm-tree (when it fruits) when it ripens, (and pay the due thereofupon the harvest day) it could also mean upon measuring it, (and be not prodigal) do not spend indisobedience of Allah nor prevent the obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: do not forbid theBahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah and the Ham. (Lo! Allah loveth not the prodigals) those who spend indisobedience of Allah; or it could mean: the idolaters. It is said that this verse was revealed about Thabit IbnQays who collected with his own hands the harvest of 500 palm-trees and gave it away, not leaving a thingfor his own family.
6|142|(And of the cattle) He creates of the cattle (some for burdens) like camels and oxen, (some for food) andsome not for burdens such as sheep and young camels. (Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed upon you) ofcrops and cattle, (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) what the devil has made seem fair by forbiddingsome crops and cattle, (for lo! he is an open foe to you) whose enmity is quite manifest, for he commandsyou to forbid some crops and cattle.
6|143|(Eight pairs) He created eight pairs: (Of the sheep twain) male and female, (and of the goats twain) maleand female. (Say) to Malik, O Muhammad: (Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females) is theprohibition of the Bahirah and Wasilah because of the fluids of the two males or those of the two females,(or that which the wombs of the two females contain) before copulation? (Expound to me (the case) withknowledge, if ye are truthful) that Allah has made unlawful that which you claim.
6|144|(And of the camels) and He created of the camels (twain) male and female (and of the oxen twain) maleand female. (Say) O Muhammad, to Malik: (Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females) is theprohibition of the Bahirah and Wasilah because of the fluids of the two males or those of the two females,(or that which the wombs of the two females contain) before copulation? Another way of understanding thisis as follows: is this prohibited because what is delivered is male or because it is female? (or were ye by towitness when Allah commanded you (all) this) all that you claim? (Then who doth greater wrong) who ismore insolent and bolder vis-�-vis Allah (than he who deviseth) invents (a lie concerning Allah, that he maylead mankind astray) from Allah's religion and obedience (without knowledge) from Allah. (Lo! Allah guidethnot) does not direct to His religion and proof (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters, meaning: Malik Ibn 'Awf.
6|145|Malik Ibn 'Awf understood what was required of him and kept silent. Instead, he said: "Let me hear fromyou, O Muhammad, why our forefathers forbade them". So Allah said: (Say) O Muhammad: (I find not inthat which is revealed unto me) i.e. the Qur'an (aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except itbe carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh for that verily is foul) unlawful (or the abomination) animmolated animal (which was immolated to the name of other than Allah) intentionally. (But whoso iscompelled (thereto)) whoever is forced to eat the meat of carrion, (neither craving) i.e. without infringementon Muslims nor deeming the meat of carrion lawful in other than necessity (nor transgressing) norcommitting highway robbery or intentionally eating of the meat of carrion without being compelled to do so,((for him) lo! your Lord is Forgiving) if he eats to satiety, (Merciful) in that which He made dispensation forhim. However, he ought not to eat to satiety, and if he does, Allah will pardon him.
6|146|(Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws) every bird with claws and every predatoryanimal with teeth, as well as every beast that has claws such as camels, ducks, geese, egrets and rabbits.All these were forbidden for them. (And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof)i.e. the fat spread between the bowels and intestines and the fat spread over the kidneys (save that uponthe backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone) such as the tail; all these were lawful forthem. (That) which We made unlawful for them (We awarded them) We punished them (for their rebellion)because of their transgression We made all these forbidden for them. (And lo! We verily are Truthful) inwhat We have said.
6|147|(So if they give the lie to thee) O Muhammad regarding the prohibitions that We described to you, (say:Your Lord is a Lord of all-embracing mercy) towards the pious and sinner alike, in that He defers torment tothe next life, (and His wrath) His torment (will never be withdrawn from guilty folk) the idolaters.
6|148|(They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed (unto Him) partners neither had ourfathers nor had we forbidden aught) of crops and cattle, but this has been commanded and forbidden forus. (Thus) just as did your people give the lie (did those who were before them give the lie) to theirmessengers (till they tasted of the fear of Us) Our torment. (Say) O Muhammad: (Have ye any knowledge)any clarification regarding what you describe as unlawful (that ye can adduce for us? Lo! ye follow naughtbut an opinion) your prohibition of crops and cattle is nothing but surmise. (Lo! Ye do but guess) you justlie.
6|149|(Say) to them, O Muhammad, if you do not have an argument for your claim, then (For Allah's is the finalargument) the most firm argument. (Had He willed He could indeed have guided all of you) to His religion.
6|150|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Come, bring your witnesses who can bear witness that Allah forbade (all)this) that you claim of crops and cattle. (And if they) falsely (bear witness) that they are forbidden, (do notyou bear witness with them. Follow thou not the whims of those who deny Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an,(those who believe not in the Hereafter) in resurrection after death (and deem (others) equal with theirLord) take idols as His partners.
6|151|(Say) O Muhammad to Malik Ibn 'Awf and his fellows: (Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lordhath made a sacred duty for you) in the Scripture that was revealed to me: (that ye ascribe no thing aspartner unto Him) the first thing is that you do not associate with Him any of the idols (and that you dogood to parents) you be dutiful to parents, (and that ye slay not your children) your daughters (because ofpenury) out of fear of humiliation and poverty. (We provide for you and for them) i.e. for your children (andthat ye draw not nigh to lewd things) fornication (whether open) i.e. open fornication (or concealed) takinglovers in secret. (And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred, save in the course of justice) asa result of cases such as retaliation, stoning, apostasy. (This He hath commanded you) in the Qur'an, (inorder that you may discern) His command and divine Oneness.
6|152|(And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better) through protecting it and makingit grow; (till he reach maturity) legal age and shows righteousness in his character. (Give full measure andfull weight, in justice. We task not any soul) upon measuring and weighing (beyond its scope) beyond itseffort to establish justice. (And if you give your word, do justice thereunto) be truthful, (even though it be(against) a kinsman) you should be truthful and say what is true; (and fulfil the covenant of Allah. This Hecommandeth you that haply ye may remember) haply you may heed the admonition.
6|153|(And (He commandeth you, saying): This) Islam (is My straight path) it is well established and I am pleasedwith it, (so follow it. Follow not other ways) i.e. Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, (lest ye be partedfrom His way) from His religion: (This hath He ordained for you) He commanded for you in the Book, (thatye may ward off (evil)) that you may ward off these different ways.
6|154|(Again, We gave the Scripture) the Torah (unto Moses, complete) with commands and prohibitions,promises and threats, reward and punishment (for him who would do good) for him who is in a good state;it is also said that this means: for him who follows the excellence of Moses and the conveyance of themessage of his Lord, (an explanation of all things) He says: it is an exposition of all things regarding thelawful and the unlawful, (a guidance) from error (and a mercy) that absolves the one who believes in Allahfrom His torment, (that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord) that they might believe inresurrection after death.
6|155|(And this is a blessed) comprises mercy and forgiveness for the person who believes (Scripture) i.e. theQur'an (which We have revealed) which We have sent Gabriel with. (So follow it) follow its lawful andunlawful, commands and prohibitions (and ward off (evil)) ward off other than it, (that ye may find mercy)and not be tormented.
6|156|(Lest ye should say) so that you will not say, O people of Mecca, on the Day of Judgement: (The Scripturewas revealed only to two sects) the people of two religions (before us) i.e. the Jews and Christians, (and wein sooth were unaware) ignorant (of what they read) their reading of the Torah and the Gospel;
6|157|(Or lest you should say) and so that you will not say on the Day of Judgement: (If the Scripture had beenrevealed unto us) as it was revealed to the Jews and Christians, (we surely had been better guided than arethey) we would be swifter in answering the Messenger and we would also have a sounder religion. (Nowhath there come unto you a clear proof) a clarification (from your Lord) i.e. the Qur'an and the Messenger,(a guidance) from error (and a mercy) for the one who believes in him; (and who doeth greater wrong) whois more insolent and more daring vis-�-vis Allah (than he who denieth the revelations of Allah) who deniesMuhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (and turneth away from them? We award unto those who turn awayfrom Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (an evil doom) a severe torment (because of theiraversion) vis-�-vis Muhammad and the Qur'an.
6|158|(Wait they) i.e. the people of Mecca, (indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them)to take their souls away at the moment of death, (or thy Lord should come) on the Day of Judgement, andHis coming is without modality, (or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord) i.e. the rising ofthe sun from the West? (In the day when one of the portents from they Lord cometh) before the rising ofthe sun from the West, (its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore) before the rising of the sun fromthe West (believed not, nor in its belief earned good) nor was it sincere in its belief, nor doing any goodworks before the rising of the sun from the West. This is because no faith, works or repentance areaccepted from an unbeliever who embraces Islam upon seeing the sun rise from the West, unless thatperson is young at that time or is born after. In such a case, if he leaves Islam after the sun rises from theWest and then returns to Islam, his repentance is accepted. Likewise, the repentance of a sinning believerwho repents of his sins after the sun rises from the West is accepted. (Say) O Muhammad to the people ofMecca: (Wait you) the Day of Judgement! (Lo! We (too) are waiting) for your punishment on the Day ofJudgement or before the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: Say, O Muhammad, wait for mydestruction, I am also waiting for yours.
6|159|(Lo! As for those who sunder their religion) those who have left the religion of their forefathers; it is alsosaid that this means: those turned back on their pledge on the Day of the primordial Covenant; it can alsobe understood to mean: those who differed in their religion (and become schismatics) they became differentgroups: Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, (no concern at all hast thou with them) you are notrequired to fight them. However, he was later commanded to fight them. It is also said that this means:their repentance or punishment are not in your hands. (Their case will go to Allah, who then will tell themwhat they used to do) of good and evil.
6|160|(Whoso bringeth a good deed) while confessing Allah's divine Oneness (will receive tenfold the like thereof,while whoso bringeth an ill deed) while ascribing partners to Allah (will be awarded but the like thereof) i.e.the Fire; (and they will not be wronged) their good deeds will not be diminished nor will their bad deeds beincreased.
6|161|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca, the Jews and to the Christians: (Lo! As for me, my Lord hathguided me unto a straight path) my Lord has honoured me with His religion and has commanded me to callpeople to His religion; it is also said that this means: my Lord has shown how to call people to His to (a rightreligion, the community of Abraham) the religion of Abraham, (the upright) who surrendered to Allah and(who was no idolater) he did not follow the idolaters in their religion.
6|162|(Say) O Muhammad: (Lo! my worship) the five daily prayers (and, my sacrifice) my religion, proof, sacrificeand worship (and my living and my dying are for Allah) in this world are for the sake of Allah's obedienceand pleasure, (Lord of the Worlds) the Master of the jinn and human beings.
6|163|(He hath no partner. This am I commanded, and I am first of those who surrender (unto Him)) I am the firstof those who sincerely worship Him and confess His divine Oneness.
6|164|(Say) O Muhammad: (Shall I seek another than Allah for Lord) shall I worship other than Allah, (when He isLord of all things) when everything is from Him? (Each soul earneth) of sins (only on its own account) as apunishment, (nor doth any laden bear another's load) of sins; it is also said that this means: no soul shall betaken to task for the sins of another soul; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be tormented forcommitting no sin; as it is said that this means: no soul bears the burden of another soul with pleasure; itdoes so only when it is forced. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after you die (and He will tell you thatwherein) in Religion (you differed) you contravened.
6|165|(He it is who hath placed you as vicegerents of the earth) in the place of past nations (and hath exaltedsome of you in rank above others) in merit in terms of wealth and servants, (that He may try you) that Hemay test you (by (the test of) that which He hath given you) of wealth and servants. (Lo! Thy Lord is swiftin prosecution) towards the one who disbelieves in Him or who does not give thanks to Him, (and lo!

Allah made these practices unlawful. (Say) O Muhammad: (Such) the goodthings, (on the Day of Resurrection, will be only for those who believed during the life of the world) inMuhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, while both believer and sinner will enjoy them during the life of thisworld.

And lo! the sequel) Paradise (is for thosewho keep their duty (unto Him)) those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies.
7|129|(They said:) O Moses, (We suffered hurt) we were tormented by the killing of our sons, the use of ourwomen and also by working (before thou camest unto us, and since thou hast come unto us) with themessage. (He) Moses (said: it may be) the expression 'may be' ['asa] when used in relation to Allah denotescategoricalness (that your Lord is going to destroy your adversary) Pharaoh and by means of drought andhunger (and make you vicegerents in the earth) make you in the inhabitants of the land of Egypt, (that Hemay see how ye behave) with regard to obeying Him.
7|130|(And We straitened Pharaoh's folk with famine) and hunger, year after year (and the dearth of fruits) thedisappearance of fruits, (that peradventure they might heed) that they might take admonition.
7|131|(But whenever good) land fertility, abundance and comfort (befell them, they said: This is ours) this is ourright; (and whenever evil) drought, lack of fruits and hardship (smote them they ascribed it to the evilauspices of Moses and those with him). Allah said: (Surely their evil auspice) their hardship and abundance(was only with Allah. But most of them) all of them (knew not) this nor believed in it.
7|132|(And they said:) O Moses, whenever and (Whatever portent) sign (thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us)to dazzle our eyes with, (we shall not put faith in thee) we shall not believe in the message, and so Moses(pbuh) prayed against them.
7|133|(So We sent them) Allah inflicted upon them (the flood) continuous, uninterrupted rain: day and night, fromSaturday to Saturday (and the locusts) He sent on the locust which ate everything that the earth produced:vegetation and fruits (and the vermin) and He also inflicted them with the vermin-crawling creatures withoutwings-which devoured whatever the locusts left uneaten (and the frogs) and after this He set on them frogsso much so that they harmed them (and the blood) after which He inflicted on them blood such that theirwells and rivers filled with blood (a succession of clear signs) of one month interval. (But they werearrogant) and refused to believe (and became guilty) idolaters.
7|134|(And when the terror fell on them) whenever a torment fell on them such as the flood, locusts, vermin, frogsand blood (they cried: O Moses! Pray for us unto your Lord) ask your Lord for us, (because He hath acovenant with thee) because of that with which He has commanded you. (If thou removest the terror fromus) if you remove the punishment from us (we verily will trust thee) we will believe in you (and will let theChildren of Israel go with thee) with all their property.
7|135|(But when We did remove from them the terror) the punishment (for a term which they must reach) i.e. thedrowning, (behold! they broke their covenant) they broke their pledge to Moses.
7|136|(Therefore We took retribution from them) once and for all; (therefore We drowned them in the sea:because they denied Our) nine (revelations and were heedless of them) they were disbelievers in them.
7|137|(And We caused the folk who were despised) who were humiliated (to inherit the eastern parts of the land)the land of Jerusalem, Palestine, Jordan and Egypt (and the western parts thereof which We had blessed)part of it with water and trees. (And the fair word of the Lord) to reward them with Paradise or victory (wasfulfilled) became incumbent (for the Children of Israel because of their endurance) in the face of affliction; itis also said: for their endurance upon their religion; (and We annihilated) destroyed ((all) that Pharaoh andhis folk had done) of castles and townships (and that they had contrived) and that which they had plantedof trees and vines; it is also said that this means: that which they had built.
7|138|(And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and they came unto a people) called al-Raqim,remnants of the people of Abraham, (who were given up to idols which they had) who worshipped idols.(They said: O Moses! Make for us a god) show us a god to worship (even as they have gods) to worship.(He) Moses (said: Lo! ye are a folk who know not) the command of Allah.
7|139|(Lo! as for these, their way) their idolatry (will be destroyed and all that they are doing) of idolatry (is invain) is error.
7|140|(He) Moses (said: Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah) shall I command you to worship another lord(when He hath favoured you above (all) creatures) of your time, through surrender unto Him?
7|141|(And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk) from Pharaoh and his people (who wereafflicting you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons) your little sons (and sparing) and using (yourwomen) your grown up women. (That) your deliverance (was a tremendous trial) blessing (from your Lord)it is also said that this means: there is in His punishment a tremendous test.
7|142|(And when We did appoint for Moses) to spend in the mountain (thirty nights (of solitude)) the month of theDhu'l-Qa'dah, (and added to them ten) days from the month of Dhu'l-Hijjah, (and he completed the wholetime appointed by his Lord of forty nights) as he promised; (and Moses said unto his brother: Take myplace) be my deputy (among the people. Do right) enjoin them to do right, (and follow not the way ofmischief-makers) by committing transgressions.
7|143|(And when Moses came to Our appointed tryst) in Midian (and his Lord had spoken unto him, he said: MyLord! Show me (Thy self)) he wished to see Allah, (that I may gaze upon Thee. He) Allah (said: Thou wiltnot see Me) you will not be able to see me in the life of this world, O Moses, (but gaze upon the mountain)the highest mountain in Midian! (If it stand still in its place) if the mountain stands still when seeing Me,(then thou wilt see Me) then may be you will see Me. (And when his Lord revealed (His) glory to themountain) to Mount Zubayr (He sent it crashing down. And Moses fell down senseless) he passed out. (Andwhen he woke) from his fainting (he said: Glory unto Thee!) he glorified His Lord (I turn unto Theerepentant) from asking to see You, (and I am the first of (true) believers) that you will not be seen in the lifeof this world.
7|144|(He said : O Moses! I have preferred thee above mankind) above the Children of Israel (by My messagesand by My speaking (unto thee). So hold that which I have given thee) act upon that which I have givenyou, (and be among the thankful) that I chose to speak to you from among all people.
7|145|(And We wrote for him, upon the tablets, the lesson) the prohibition (to be drawn from all things and theexplanation of all things) of the lawful and the unlawful, commands and prohibitions, (then (bade him): Holdit fast) act upon it seriously and diligently; (and command your people (saying): Take the better (coursemade clear) therein) act upon that which is unambiguous and believe in that which is ambiguous. (I shallshow thee the abode of evil-livers) the abode of the transgressors which is hell; it is also said that this refersto Iraq, just as it is said that it refers to Egypt.
7|146|(I shall turn away from My revelations) from believing in My revelations (those who magnify themselveswrongfully) without any right (in the earth) it is also said that this means: I will show you, O Muhammad,the abode of evil-doers: the abode of Badr, and it is said that this is the abode of Mecca, (and if they) i.e.Pharaoh and his folk; it is also said that it refers to Abu Jahl and his folk (see each token believe it not, andif they see the way of righteousness) the way of Islam and goodness (choose it not for (their) way) theywould not consider it a way, (and if they see the way of error) the way of disbelief and idolatry (choose it for(their) way) they would consider it a way. (That is because they deny Our revelations) Our Scripture andMessenger (and are used to disregard them) disbelieving in them.
7|147|(Those who deny Our revelations) those who disbelieve in Our Scripture and Messenger (and the meeting ofthe Hereafter) and disbelieve in resurrection after death, (their works are fruitless) their good deeds arenullified due to their idolatry. (Are they requited) that which they are requited of in the Hereafter (aughtsave what they used to do) and say of evil in the life of this world?
7|148|(And the folk of Moses, after (he had left them)) to go in retreat in the mountain, (chose) made (a calf (forworship), (made) out of their ornaments, of saffron hue) of their gold, (which gave a lowing sound) a soundthat the Samiri made for them. (Saw they not) did the people of Moses not know (that it spake not untothem) i.e. the calf (nor guided them to any way? They chose it) they worshipped the calf out of ignorance,(and became wrong-doers) and they harmed themselves by worshipping it.
7|149|(And when they feared the consequences thereof) and when they regretted having worshipped the calf (andsaw) and knew and were certain (that they had gone astray) from the Truth and guidance, (they said:Unless our Lord have mercy on us and forgive us) and hence torment us, (we verily are of the lost) byreceiving the punishment.
7|150|(And when Moses returned unto his people, angry and grieved) when he heard the voice of sedition, (hesaid: Evil is that (course) which ye took after I had left you) evil is what you did by worshipping the calf afterI went to the mountain. (Would ye hasten on the judgement of your Lord) would you hasten by worshippingthe calf the promise of your Lord? (And he cast down the tablets) from his hand and two of them werebroken, (and he seized his brother by the head) i.e. by Aaron's hair, (dragging him towards him. He) Aaron(said: Son of my mother!) they were full brothers, but he mentioned their mother so that Moses might begentle with him (Lo! the folk did judge me weak) humiliated me (and almost killed me) due to myopposition. (Oh, make not mine enemies to triumph over me) make not the enemy, the folk of the calf, spiteme (and place me not among the evil-doers!) do not harm me because of the folk of the calf.
7|151|(He) Moses (said: My Lord! Have mercy on me) because of what I did to Aaron (and on my brother) Aaronbecause he did not fight them; (bring us into Thy mercy) in Your Garden, (Thou the Most Merciful of all whoshow mercy) towards us.

7|153|(But those who do ill deeds) while ascribing partners to Allah (and afterward repent) after their idolatry; it isalso said that this means: after committing transgressions (and believe) profess Allah's divine Oneness andbelieve in Allah (lo! for them, afterward) after repentance and accepting faith, (your Lord) O Moses; and it isalso said: O Muhammad (is Forgiving) He overlooks sins, (Merciful).
7|154|(Then, when the anger of Moses abated, he took up the tablets, and in their inscription) in what remained inthem; it is also said: in what was returned to him of the two tablets (there was guidance) from error (andmercy) preventing from torment (for all those who fear their Lord).
7|155|(And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came onthem) and killed them, (he said: My Lord!

(Wilt Thou destroy us for that which theignorant among us did) when they worshipped the calf-here Moses thought they were destroyed because oftheir worship of the calf? (It is but Thy trial (of us)) Your affliction upon us. (Thou sendest whom Thou wiltastray and guidest whom Thou wilt) to avoid the sedition. (Thou art our Protecting Friend) You have betterright to have mercy on us, (therefore forgive us and have mercy on us) and do not punish us, (Thou, theBest of all who show forgiveness) overlook sins.

(He) Allah (said: I smite with)I single out with (My punishment whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things) whether the person isrighteous or sinner. Iblis seized this opportunity and said: "I am of the things", but Allah excluded him fromthis by saying: (therefore I shall ordain it for those who ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry and indecencies(and pay the poor-due) and give from their wealth what is due to the poor, (and those who believe Ourrevelations) believe in Our Scripture and Messenger. The people of the Book seized this opportunity andsaid: "we are the people of God-fearingness and Scripture", but Allah excluded them from this and explainedto whom this mercy is ordained, saying:

(He will make lawful forthem all good things) he explains to them the lawfulness of that which is in the Scripture such as the meatand milk of camels, sheep and others (and prohibit for them only the foul) he explains to them theunlawfulness of what is in the Scripture such as carrion, the meat of swine and other things; (and he willrelieve them of their burden) their pledges the breaking of which made good things unlawful for them (andthe fetters) the hardships (that they used to wear) such as tearing up their clothes and other things. (Thenthose who believe in him) in Muhammad (pbuh) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, (and honour him)and assist him (and help him) with the sword, (and follow the light) the Qur'an (which is sent down withhim) which was sent with Gabriel: that which is lawful, they declared lawful, and that which unlawful, theydeclared unlawful: (they are the successful) who are saved from Allah's wrath and torment.

7|159|(And of Moses' folk there is a community) a group (who lead with) enjoin (truth and establish justicetherewith) they act upon the Truth. These are those beyond the river al-Raml.
7|160|(We divided them into twelve tribes, nations) tribe by tribe: nine tribes and a half towards the East, wherethe sun rises, beyond China, on the river al-Raml (also called Jordan), and two tribes and a half all over theworld; (and We inspired Moses) We commanded Moses, (when his people asked him for water) in thewilderness, (saying: Smite with thy staff) which is with you (the rock! And there gushed forth therefrom)from the rock (twelve springs) rivers, (so that each tribe knew their drinking place) from the river. (And wecaused the white cloud to overshadow them) in the wilderness: in the day it protected them from the sunand in the night, it lit for them like a lamp (and sent down for them the manna and the quails) in thewilderness ((saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you): the manna and the quails.(They wronged Us not) they did not hurt or harm Us because of what they committed, (but they were wontto wrong themselves) to harm and hurt themselves.
7|161|(And when it was said unto them: Dwell in this township) the town of Jericho (and eat therefrom whence yewill) and whenever you will, (and say "Repentance") and say: there is no deity except Allah; it is also saidthat this means: forgive our sins, (and enter the gate) the gate of Jericho (prostrate; We shall forgive youyour sins; We shall increase (reward) for the right doers) in their good works.
7|162|(But those of them who did wrong) the sinning people (changed the word which had been told them foranother saying) they were commanded to say "hittah [there is no deity except Allah; or as in the othermeaning: forgive our sins"] but instead said "hintah [wheat]", (and We sent down upon them wrath fromheaven) We sent upon them the plague from heaven (for their wrong-doing) for changing what they werecommanded to say.
7|163|(Ask them) the Jews, O Muhammad (of the township) about the story of the township called Aylah (that wasby the sea, how they did break the Sabbath) they used to transgress on the Sabbath by taking the fish,(how their big fish came unto them visibly) scores and scores of them, from deep inside up to the shore(upon their Sabbath day and on a day when they did not keep Sabbath came they not unto them. Thus didWe try them) test them (for that they were evil-livers) transgressors.
7|164|(And when a community) a group (among them said: Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is about todestroy) by turning them into animals (and punish with an awful doom) with the Fire, (they said: In order tobe free from guilt before your Lord) in order to have an argument before your Lord, (and that haply theymay ward off (evil)) ward off taking the fish on the Sabbath. These were three people who used to catchfish on the Sabbath and encouraged others to do so too. There was another group of people who did notcatch fish on the Sabbath but did not warn others against doing so. And lastly there was another group ofpeople who did not catch the fish on the Sabbath and warned others against doing so. Allah turned thosewho caught fish on the Sabbath and enjoined others to do so into animals and spared the others.
7|165|(And when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded) and when they left what they werecommanded to do, (We rescued those who forbade wrong) i.e. catching fish on the Sabbath, (and visitedthose who did wrong) by catching fish on the Sabbath (with dreadful) a severe (punishment because theywere evil-livers) because they were transgressors.

(And We have tried them with good things) andWe have tested them with land fertility, abundance and comfort (and evil things) drought, lack of harvestand hardship (that haply they might return) they might repent of their transgression and disbelief.

It is also said that thereference here is to Umayyah Ibn al-Salt whom Allah honoured with knowledge and good speech but whenhe did not believe, Allah took this away from him, (so Satan overtook him) Satan deluded him (and hebecame of those who lead astray) he became of the erring disbelievers.

8|58|(And if thou fearest) and if you know of a (treachery from any folk) from the Banu Qurayzah in that theybroke their treaty, (then throw back to them (their treaty) fairly. Lo! Allah loveth not the treacherous) whobreak their treaties or commit any other act of treachery, whether it is the Banu Qurayzah or others.
8|59|(And) O Muhammad (let not those who disbelieve) whether from the Banu Qurayzah or somewhere else(suppose that they can outstrip) Our punishment due to the things they have done and said. (Lo! theycannot escape) Our punishment.
8|60|(Make ready for them) for the Banu Qurayzah as well as for others (all thou canst of force) of arms (and ofhorses tethered) of female tethered horses which are prepared for fighting, (that thereby ye may dismay)that you may strike fear by means of these horses in (the enemy of Allah) with regard to religion (and yourenemy) by killing them, (and others beside them) besides the Banu Qurayzah and all the Arabs; it is alsosaid that this is a reference to the disbelievers among the jinn (whom you know not) you do not know theirnumber. (Allah knoweth them) Allah knows their number. (Whatsoever) of wealth (you spend in the way ofAllah) in obedience of Allah, whether it is arms or horses (it will be repaid to you in full) its reward will berepaid to you, none of it will be diminished, (and ye will not be wronged) your reward will not be diminished.
8|61|(And if they incline to peace) if the Banu Qurayzah incline to and desire peace, (incline you also to it) anddesire it, (and trust in Allah) in relation to their breaking or honouring of treaties. (Lo! He is the Hearer) ofwhat they say, (the Knower) of their breaking and honouring of treaties.
8|62|(And if they) the Banu Qurayzah (would deceive thee) by signing a treaty of peace with you, (then lo! Allahis sufficient for thee) Allah is sufficient and enough for you. (He it is Who supporteth thee) He gives youstrength and assists you (with His help) on the Day of Badr (and with the believers) with the Aws and theKhazraj,
8|63|(And (as for the believers) hath attuned their hearts) he united their hearts and word by means of Islam. (Ifthou hadst spent all that is in the earth) of gold and silver (thou couldst not have attuned their hearts) ortheir word, (but Allah hath attuned them) He united their hearts by means of faith. (Lo! He is Mighty) in Hiskingdom and sovereignty, (Wise) in His command and decree.
8|64|(O Prophet! Allah is sufficient for thee and those who follow thee of the believers) the Aws and the Khazraj.
8|65|(O Prophet! Exhort the believers) prompt and encourage them (to fight) on the Day of Badr. (If there be ofyou twenty steadfast) in war, seeking their reward only from Allah (they shall overcome two hundred) of theidolaters, (and if there be of you a hundred steadfast they shall overcome) shall fight (a thousand of thosewho disbelieve, because they (the disbelievers) are a folk without intelligence) they do not understand thecommand of Allah and His divine Oneness.
8|66|(Now hath Allah lightened your burden, for He knoweth that there is weakness in you) in relation to fighting.(So if there be of you a steadfast hundred) who seek their reward only from Allah (they shall overcome)they shall fight (two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand (steadfast) they shall overcome) they shallfight (two thousand by permission of Allah. Allah is with the steadfast) He helps the steadfast in war bymaking them triumphant.
8|67|(It is not for any Prophet) it is not proper for any Prophet (to have captives) from among disbelievers (untilhe hath made slaughter) until he conquers (in the land) by means of fighting. (Ye desire the lure of thisworld) by taking ransoms for the prisoners of Badr (and Allah desireth (for you) the Hereafter, and Allah isMighty) in His retribution against His enemies, (Wise) by helping His friends.
8|68|(Had it not been for an ordinance of Allah which had gone before) had it not been for Allah's decree thatspoils of war were lawful for the community of Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said that this means: had it notbeen that Allah decreed felicity for the people of Badr, (an awful) a severe (doom had come upon you onaccount of what ye took) would have befallen you because of the ransoms you took.
8|69|(Now enjoy what ye have won) at Badr of spoils of war, (as lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah)and fear Allah regarding this. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He overlooks transgressions, (Merciful) regarding thatwhich ensued from you at Badr concerning the ransom of prisoners.
8|70|(O Prophet, Say unto those captives who are in your hands) i.e. 'Abbas [Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib]: If Allahknoweth any good) faith and sincerity (in your hearts He will give you better than that which hath beentaken from you) of ransom, (and will forgive you) the sins you committed in the pre-Islamic period. (Lo!Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) towards he who believes in Him.
8|71|(And if they would betray thee) through faith, O Muhammad, (they betrayed Allah before) this, by shunningfaith and committing transgressions, (and He gave (thee) power over them) He made you triumph overthem at Badr. (Allah is Knower) of what is in their hearts of treachery, (Wise) in that which He decreed uponthem.
8|72|(Lo! those who believed) in Muhammad and in the Qur'an (and left their homes) in Mecca and headedtowards Medina (and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah,(and those who took them in) those who hosted Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions in Medina (in andhelped them) on the Day of Badr; (these are protecting friends one of another) in inheritance. (And thosewho believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (but did not leave their homes) in Mecca to migrateto Medina, (ye have no duty to protect them) you do not inherit them, nor do they inherit you (till they leavetheir homes) and migrate to Medina; (but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion) if they seekyour help against their enemies in religion (then it is your duty to help (them)) against their enemies (exceptagainst a folk between whom and you there is a treaty) in which case you should not help them, but rathertry to make peace between them. (Allah is Seer of what ye do) regarding peace and other things.
8|73|(And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another-) in the matter of inheritance (If ye do not so)divide estate between relatives as has been explained to you, (there will be confusion in the land) throughidolatry and apostasy, (and great corruption) by means of killings and transgression.
8|74|(Those who believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and left their homes) and migrated fromMecca to Medina (and strove for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah, (and those who took them in)those who hosted Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions (and helped them) at Badr (these are thebelievers in truth) truly and certainly. (For them is pardon) for the sins they committed in the life of thisworld, (and a bountiful provision) a good reward in Paradise.
8|75|(And those who afterwards) after the first Emigrants (believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (andleft their homes) and migrated from Mecca to Medina (and strove along with you) against the enemy, (theyare of you) they are with you in secret and openly; (and those who are akin) those who are related by theirlineage, the closer then the one who comes next, etc., (are nearer one to another) in relation to the divisionof estates (in the ordinance of Allah) in the Guarded Tablet. With this verse, the first verse was abrogated.(Lo! Allah is Knower) He knows the idolaters' breaking of their treaties (of all things) the division of estates,what is good for you as well as other things. And Allah knows best the inner meanings of His Scripture'.
9|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding Allah's saying: (Freedom fromobligation): '(Freedom from obligation) this is freedom from obligation (from Allah and His messengertowards those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty) but then they broke that treaty; freedom fromobligation is the breaking of treaties. Allah says: whosoever has a treaty with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)let him know that it is broken. Some of them had a treaty lasting four months, and some of more ninemonths, while others had treaties for longer or shorter periods. Others had no treaty with Allah's Messengerat all. All these treaties were broken except for the treaty with the Banu Kinanah which was for nine months.Whoever had a treaty for more or less than four months, their treaties were ratified to last four monthbeginning from the day of immolation; and whoever had a treaty of four months, that treaty was ratified tolast four months beginning from the day of immolation. Those who had a treaty of nine months, theirtreaties were left as they were, while those who did not sign any treaty, were granted one of 50 daysbeginning from the day of immolation until the departure of the person who was in a state of ritualconsecration:
9|2|Allah said to them (Travel freely in the land) move about in the land beginning from the day of immolationfor (four months) safe from being killed because of the treaty, (and know) O disbelievers (that ye cannotescape Allah) that you cannot escape Allah's punishment, by being killed, after the lapse of a the fourmonths (and that Allah will confound the disbelievers) He will punish the disbelievers after four months bysubjecting them to death.
9|3|(And a proclamation from Allah) and this is a declaration from Allah (and His messenger to all men on theday of the Greater Pilgrimage) on the day of immolation (that Allah is free from obligation to the idolaters)their religion, and the treaties they broke, (and (so is) His messenger) he is also free from obligation tothem. (So, if ye repent) from idolatry and believe in Allah and Muhammad (pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an,(it will be better for you) than idolatry; (but if ye are averse) to faith and repentance, (then know) Oidolaters (that ye cannot escape Allah) you cannot escape His punishment. (Give tidings (O Muhammad) of apainful doom to those who disbelieve) i.e. that they will be killed after the elapse of four months.
9|4|(Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye (Muslims) have a treaty) i.e. the Banu Kinanah after the yearof al-Hudaybiyyah, (and who have since abated nothing of your right) who they did not break their treaties,i.e. those who had a nine month treaty (nor have supported anyone) of your enemies (against you. (As forthese), fulfil their treaty to them till their term) i.e. nine months. (Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty(unto Him)) by not breaking their treaties.
9|5|(Then, when the sacred months have passed) then after the day of immolation when the month ofMuharram passes, (slay the idolaters) whose treaty is for fifty days (wherever ye find them) whether in theSacred Precinct or outside it, during the sacred months or at any other time, (and take them (captive))imprison them, (and besiege them) in their homes, (and prepare for them each ambush) on every road theytread for trade. (But if they repent) from idolatry and believe in Allah (and establish worship) andacknowledge the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) acknowledge the payment of the poor-due, (thenleave their way free) if they wish to go to the House of Allah. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoeverrepents, (Merciful) towards whosoever dies in a state of repentance.
9|6|(And if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection (O Muhammad), then protect him so that he may hearthe word of Allah) so that he may hear your recitation of the words of Allah; (and afterward convey him tohis place of safety) to the place he is going, if he remains an unbeliever. (That) which I have mentioned (isbecause they are a folk who know not) Allah's command and His divine Oneness.
9|7|(How) this is said by way of astonishment (can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for theidolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship?) after the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, the reference here is to the Banu Kinanah. (So long as they are true to you) in that theyhonour their treaty, (be true to them) completely. (Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty) and abstainfrom breaking their treaties.
9|8|(How) this is also said by way of astonishment: how can there be any treaty between you and them (when,if they have the upper hand of you) they were to conquer you, (they regard no pact) they would have noregard for the ties of kinship relating you ; it is also said: they would have no regard for you in respect ofAllah (nor honour about you?) because of the treaty between you. (They satisfy you with their mouths) withtheir tongues (the while their hearts refuse) while their hearts are averse to it. (And most of them) all ofthem (are wrong-doers) breakers of treaties.
9|9|(They have purchased with the revelations of Allah) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (a little gain) asmall profit, (so they debar (men) from His way) from His religion and obedience. (Lo! evil is that which theyare wont to do) evil is that which they used to do of concealment and other things. It is also said that thisverse was revealed about the Jews.
9|10|(And they observe towards a believer neither pact) ties of kinship; it is also said that the reference here is toAllah (nor honour) because of the treaties they signed. (These are they who are transgressors) who shiftedfrom that which is lawful to that which is prohibited, by breaking their treaties and committing other things.
9|11|(But if they repent) from idolatry and believe in Allah (and establish worship) acknowledge the prayers (andpay the poor-due) and acknowledge the poor-due, (then are they your brethren in religion) in Islam. (Wedetail Our revelations) We explain the Qur'an by means of expositing the commands and prohibitions (for apeople who have knowledge) and believe.
9|12|(And if they) the people of Mecca (break their pledges) which are between you and them (after their treaty(has been made with you) and assail your religion) and defame the Religion of Islam, (then fight the headsof disbelief) fight the leaders of disbelief: Abu Sufyan and his host. (Lo! they have no binding oaths in orderthat they may desist) from breaking their pledges.
9|13|(Will ye not fight a folk) why is it that you do not fight a people, i.e. the people of Mecca (who broke theirsolemn pledges) which are between them and you, (and purposed to drive out the messenger) and wantedto kill the Messenger when they entered Dar al-Nadwah (and did attack you first) by breaking their pledgewhen they helped the Banu Bakr, their allies, against the Banu Khuza'ah, the allies of the Prophet (pbuh)?(What! Fear ye them?) O believers, do you fear fighting them? (Now Allah hath more right that you shouldfear Him) because of leaving His command, (if ye are believers).
9|14|(Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands) He will chastise them by means of your swords, i.e. bykilling them, (and He will lay them low) He will abase them by means of defeat (and give you victory overthem, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers) by the exultation of the Banu Khuza'ah, in thatthey were allowed to kill their enemies for a while in the Sacred Precinct upon the Conquest of Mecca.
9|15|(And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah relenteth towards whom He will) He will relent towardswhoever repents of them. (Allah is Knower) of those who repent and of those who do not, (Wise) in thatwhich He decreed for them; it is also said that this means: He ordained their defeat and killing.
9|16|(Or deemed ye) O believers (that ye would be left (in peace)) that you would be given respite and notcommanded to fight (when Allah yet knoweth not) has not yet seen (those of you who strive) in the way ofAllah, (choosing for familiar none) of the disbelievers (save Allah and His messenger and the) sincere(believers? Allah is Informed of what ye do) of good or evil during jihad and at other places and times.
9|17|(It is not for the idolaters) the idolaters ought not (to tend Allah's sanctuaries, bearing witness againstthemselves) through their calling (of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain) their works are thwarted foras long as they remain disbelievers (and in the Fire they will abide) never to die or leave it.
9|18|(He only shall tend Allah's sanctuaries) the Inviolable Place of Worship (who believeth in Allah and the LastDay) believes in resurrection after death (and observeth proper worship) fulfils the five daily prayers (andpayeth the poor-due) which is obligated (and feareth) and worships (none save Allah. For such (only) is itpossible that they can be of the rightly guided) by means of Allah's Religion and clear proof.
9|19|The following was revealed about a man among the idolaters who was taken prisoner on the Day of Badr.He boasted to 'Ali or to another believer who took part in the battle of Badr, saying: "we give water to thepilgrims and tend to the Sacred House, and do this and that, etc.", so Allah, Exalted is He, said: (Count yethe slaking of a pilgrim's thirst) did you say that giving water to the pilgrim (and tendance of the InviolablePlace of Worship as (equal to the worth of him) who believeth in Allah) is like the faith of he who believes inAllah, i.e. the believer who took part in the battle of Badr (and the Last Day) and believes in resurrectionafter death, (and striveth in the way of Allah) and strives in obedience of Allah on the Day of Badr? (Theyare not equal in the sight of Allah) as far as obedience and reward are concerned. (Allah guideth not) leadsnot to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters, those who do not deserve it.
9|20|(Those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (and have left their homes) migrating fromMecca to Medina (and striven with their wealth and their lives) by spending their wealth and sacrificing theirlives (in Allah's way) in obedience of Allah (are of much greater worth) have much greater merit (in Allah'ssight) than others. (These are they who are triumphant) they have gained Paradise and been saved fromhell.
9|21|(Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy) of safety (from Him) from His punishment, (and acceptance)their Lord's good pleasure with them, (and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs) unending andcontinuous pleasure;
9|22|(There they will abide for ever) never to die or leave. (Lo! with Allah there is immense reward) an abundantreward to the person who believes in Him.
9|23|(O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren) who are in Mecca from among thedisbelievers (for friends) in religion (if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith) if they choosedisbelief instead of faith. (Whoso of you taketh them for friends) in religion, (such are wrong-doers)disbelievers like them; it is also said that this means: O ye who believe! take not your believing fathers andbrothers who are in Mecca, who had prevented you from migrating to Medina, for allies, seeking their helpand assistance, if they choose to remain in the abode of disbelief, i.e. Mecca, rather than migrate to theabode of Islam, i.e. Medina. Whosoever takes them for allies harms only himself.
9|24|(Say) O Muhammad: (If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your tribe)your folk who are in Mecca, (and the wealth ye have acquired) you have earned, (and merchandise forwhich ye fear that there will be no sale) that will not be spent in Medina, (and dwellings) houses (ye desire)to live in (are dearer to you than Allah) than Allah's obedience (and His messenger) and dearer to you thanmigrating to His Messenger (and striving in His way) for the sake of His obedience: (then wait till Allahbringeth His command to pass) His punishment, i.e. killing upon the Conquest of Mecca. Those whomigrated after this (Allah guideth not) He does not lead to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the disbelievers:those who not deserve it.
9|25|(Allah hath given you victory on many fields) on many battlefields (and on the day of Hunayn) and especiallyon the day of Hunayn, a valley between Mecca and Ta'if, (when ye exulted in your multitude) when youwere pleased by your sheer numbers. They were then 10,000 men (but it availed you naught) but yourmultitude did not prevent your defeat, (and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you) because of fear;(then ye turned back in flight) from the enemy, who consisted of 4,000 men;
9|26|(Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance) His tranquillity (down upon His messenger and upon thebelievers, and sent down hosts) from heaven (ye could not see) meaning angels, to assist the believers,(and punished those who disbelieved) through their killing and defeat. The reference here is to the clan ofMalik Ibn 'Awf al-Dahmani, and to that of Kinanah Ibn 'Abd Yalayl al-Thaqafi. (Such is the reward ofdisbelievers) in the life of this world.
9|27|(Then afterward) after fighting and the defeat (Allah will relent towards whom He will) towards those whorepent amongst them; (for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) towards him who repents.
9|28|(O ye who believe! The idolaters only are unclean) impure. (So let them not come near the Inviolable Placeof Worship) for pilgrimage and circumambulation (after this their year) the year of freedom from obligation(bara'ah) after the day of immolation. (If ye fear poverty) impoverishment and neediness (Allah shallpreserve you of His bounty) of His provision in another way (if He will) when He wills and will make youdispense with trading with Bakr Ibn Wa'il. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of your sustenance, (Wise) in that which Hehas ordained for you.
9|29|(Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (as believe not inAllah nor the Last Day) nor in the bliss of Paradise, (and forbid not) in the Torah (that which Allah hathforbidden by His messenger, and follow not the religion of truth) do not submit themselves to Allah throughconfession of Allah's divine Oneness, (until they pay the tribute readily) standing: from hand to hand, (beingbrought low) abased.
9|30|(And the Jews) the Jews of Medina (say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians) the Christians of Najran(say: The Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths) with their tongues. (Theyimitate the saying of those who disbelieved of old) before them, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca who said thatal-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat were His daughters, just as the Jews claimed that Ezra was the son of Allah andsome of the Christians claimed that Jesus was the son of Allah, others that he was Allah's partner whilethere were others who said that he was Allah Himself or one god among three. (Allah (Himself) fightsagainst them) Allah curses them. (How perverse are they!) from where do they get their lies?
9|31|(They have taken as lords beside Allah) i.e. they obeyed them in acts of disobedience (their rabbis) the menof knowledge among the Jews (and their monks) who reside in monasteries (and the Messiah son of Mary)and they have taken the Messiah son of Mary as lord, (when they were bidden) in all Scriptures (to worship)to confess the divine Oneness of (only One God. There is no god save Him. Be He glorified from all that theyascribe as partner (unto Him)!) Allah exalts Himself above all that which they ascribe to Him.
9|32|(Fain would they put out) thwart (the light of Allah) the religion of Allah (with their mouths) through theirlies; it is also said: by means of their mouths, (but Allah disdaineth (aught)) But Allah does not leave things(save that He shall perfect His light) save that He shall manifest His religion: Islam, (however much thedisbelievers are averse) that this should be so.
9|33|(He it is Who hath sent His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (with the guidance) with the Qur'an and faith(and the Religion of Truth) the religion of Islam, and with it the confession that there is no deity exceptAllah, (that He may cause it to prevail over all religion) that He may Cause the religion of Islam to prevailover all religions which came before it until the Day of Judgement, (however much the idolaters may beaverse) that this should be so.
9|34|(O you, who believe!) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis) thescholars of the Children of Israel (and the (Christian) monks) who reside in monasteries (devour the wealthof mankind wantonly) through bribery and unlawful earning (and debar (men) from the way of Allah) fromAllah's Religion and obedience. (They who hoard up) amass (gold and silver and spend it not) the gold andsilver (in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: who do not pay the poor-duefrom it, (unto them give tidings) O Muhammad (of a painful doom).
9|35|(On the day when it) the treasures they hoarded up (will (all) be heated in the Fire of hell, and theirforeheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith) with their treasures ((and it will be saidunto them): Here is) the punishment of (that which you hoarded) the wealth you amassed (for yourselves)in the life of this world. (Now taste of what ye used to hoard) amass.
9|36|(Lo! the number of the months with Allah) he says: the year is counted by months, i.e. the months of theyear in which the poor-due is paid (is twelve months by Allah's ordinance) in the Guarded Tablet (in the day)from the day (that He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them) four of these months (are sacred):Rajab, Dhu'l-Qa'dah, Dhu'l-Hijjah and Muharram: (that is the right religion) that is the right calculation: itneither increases or decreases. (So wrong not) harm not (yourselves) through transgression (in them) inthose months; it is also said: in the sacred months. (And wage war on all the idolaters) in the sacred monthsand in other months (as they are waging war on all of you) all together. (And know) O believers (that Allahis with those who keep their duty (unto Him)) with those who ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies, thebreaking of treaties and fighting during the sacred months.
9|37|(Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an excess of disbelief) He says: postponement of the month ofMuharram to the month of Safar is an excess of disbelief (whereby those who disbelieve are misled) they arewrong to postpone Muharram to Safar, (they allow it) i.e. Muharram (one year) and thus fight in it (andforbid it) i.e. Muharram ((another) year) and thus abstain from fighting during it. And so when they used todo this, Muharram would not be considered sacred while Safar became sacred instead, (that they may makeup) that they may match (the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed) four in number, (so thatthey allow that which Allah hath forbidden) i.e. Muharram. (The evil of their deeds is made fair-seemingunto them. Allah guideth not) leads not to His religion (the disbelieving folk) those who do not deserve it.The one who used to postpone the sacred months was a man called Nu'aym Ibn Tha'labah.

9|40|(If ye help him not) if you do not help Muhammad (pbuh) by going forth with him to the battle of Tabuk,(still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (drove him forth, the second oftwo) i.e. the Messenger of Allah and Abu Bakr; (when they two) Allah's Messenger (pbuh) and Abu Bakr,may Allah be well pleased with him, (were in the cave, when he) the Prophet (pbuh) (said unto his comrade)Abu Bakr: (Grieve not) O Abu Bakr. (Lo! Allah is with us) and He will help us. (Then Allah caused His peaceof reassurance) His tranquillity (to descend upon him) upon His Prophet (and supported him) helped him onthe Day of Badr, at the battle of the troops and also on the Day of Hunayn (with hosts ye cannot see) i.e.with angels, (and made the word) the religion (of those who disbelieved the nethermost) blameworthy anddefeated, (while Allah's word it was that became the uppermost) triumphant and praiseworthy.

9|41|(Go forth) with your Prophet to the Battle of Tabuk, (light armed and heavy armed) young and old; it is alsosaid that this means: whether you are enthusiastic for it or not; it is also said that this means: light withproperty and children and heavy with property and children, (and strive with your wealth and your lives inthe way of Allah) in obedience of Allah! (That) jihad (is best for you) than sitting remaining in one place (ifye but knew) and believed.
9|42|(Had it been a near adventure) a near spoil of war (and an easy journey they had followed thee) to theBattle of Tabuk with a good disposition of the soul, (but the distance seemed too far for them) Historic Syriaseemed too far for them.

9|45|(They alone ask leave of you) to stay behind and not take part in jihad (who believe not in Allah and theLast Day) in the depth of their hearts, (and whose hearts feel doubt, so in their doubt they waver) they arebewildered.
9|46|(And if they had wished to go forth) with you to the Battle of Tabuk (they would assuredly have made readysome equipment) weapons and provision, (but Allah was averse to their being sent forth) with you to thebattle of Tabuk (and back and (it was said unto them): Sit ye with the sedentary!) with those who stayedback without an excuse.
9|47|(Had they gone forth among you) with you (they had added to you naught save trouble) evil and corruption(and had hurried to and fro among you) they would have marched riding their camels in the middle of you,(seeking to cause sedition among you) seeking to cause evil, corruption, humiliation and damage; (andamong you there are some who would have listened to them) among you there are spies for thedisbelievers. (Allah is Aware of evil-doers) i.e. the hypocrites: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his hosts.
9|48|(Aforetime) before the battle of Tabuk (they sought to cause sedition) they sought to cause you evil things(and raised difficulties for you) right and left (till the Truth came) until the believers became many (and thedecree of Allah) the religion of Allah: Islam (was made manifest, though they were loth) of it.
9|49|(Of them) of the hypocrites (is he who saith) the reference here is to Jadd Ibn Qays: (Grant me leave) tostay at home (and tempt me not) by the women of Historic Syria. (Surely it is into temptation) idolatry andhypocrisy (that they (thus) have fallen. Lo! Hell is all around) will be all around (the disbelievers) on the Dayof Judgement.
9|50|(If good) conquest and the spoils of war as on the Day of Badr (befalleth thee (O Muhammad) it afflicteththem) i.e. the hypocrites, (and if calamity) killings and defeat (befalleth thee) such as during the Battle ofUhud, (they say) the hypocrites, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host, say: (We took precaution) by staying athome before the calamity took place, (and they turn away) from jihad (well pleased) with that which hasbefallen the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions on the Day of Uhud.
9|51|(Say) O Muhammad, to the hypocrites: (Naught befalleth us save that which Allah hath decreed for us. He isour protecting Friend) He has better right to protect us. (In Allah let believers put their trust!) the believersought to put their trust in Allah.
9|52|(Say) O Muhammad, to the hypocrites: (Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things) conquestand spoils of war or death and martyrdom? (while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a doomfrom Him) to destroy you (or at our hands) with our swords to kill you. (Await then! Lo! we are awaitingwith you) for your destruction.
9|53|(Say) O Muhammad, to the hypocrites: (Pay) your wealth, (willingly) with a good disposition of the soul (orunwillingly) coercively, out of fear from dying, (it will not be accepted from you. Lo! ye were ever frowardfolk) hypocrites.
9|54|(And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them save that they havedisbelieved in Allah and in His messenger) in secret, (and they come not to worship) to the prayer (save asidlers) lax, (and pay not) anything in the way of Allah (save reluctantly) save when they are forced to.
9|55|(So let not) O Muhammad (their riches) the abundance of their riches (nor their children) the abundance oftheir children (please thee. Allah thereby intendeth but to punish them) in the Hereafter (and that their soulsshall pass away) shall expire (in the life of the world while they are disbelievers).
9|56|(And they) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (swear by Allah that they are in truth of you) with you secretlyand openly, (when they are not of you) with you, (but they are folk who are afraid) of your swords.
9|57|(Had they but found a refuge) to run to, (or caverns) in the mountain, (or a place to enter) or anunderground passage, (they surely had resorted thither swift as runaways) they would have promptly gonethere.
9|58|(And of them) of the hypocrites: Abu'l-Ahwas and his host (is he who defameth thee in the matter of thealms) he defames you regarding the division of alms. They claimed that he did not divide them fairly. (Ifthey are given thereof) of the alms a good share (they are content) with the division, (and if they are notgiven thereof) of the alms a good share, (behold! they are enraged) in relation to the division of the same.
9|59|((How much more seemly) had they) i.e. the hypocrites (been content with that which Allah and Hismessenger had given them) of Allah's bounty (and had said: Allah sufficeth us) we trust in Allah. (Allah willgive us of His bounty) Allah will make us rich with His favour by means of His sustenance, (and (also) Hismessenger) through his gifts. (Unto Allah we are supplicants) we desire Allah. Had they said this, it wouldhave been better for them.
9|60|Allah then explained who is entitled to these alms, saying: (The alms are only for the poor) for the folk ofthe Platform (and the needy) among the pilgrims, (and those who collect them) i.e. the collectors of alms,(and those whose hearts are to be reconciled) by giving them gifts such as Abu Sufyan and his companions.These were 15 men, (and to free the captives) the captives who want to ransom themselves (and thedebtors) those who incurred debts to fulfil works which are for the obedience of Allah, (and for the cause ofAllah) and for the fighters for the cause of Allah, (and (for) the wayfarers) guests, the passer-by; (a dutyimposed by Allah) an allotment from Allah for these. (Allah is Knower) of these, (Wise) regarding that whichHe has ordained for these categories of people.
9|61|(And of them) of the hypocrites: Judham Ibn Khalid, Iyyas Ibn Qays, Sammak Ibn Yazid and 'Ubayd IbnMalik (are those who vex the Prophet) by slandering and vilifying him (and say) to one another: (He is onlya hearer) he listens to us and believes us when we tell him we have not said anything against you. (Say) tothem, O Muhammad: (A hearer of good) and not evil (for you) i.e. he listens to you and believes what isgood rather than believes that you are lying; it is also said that this means: if he is a hearer, then it is goodfor you, (who believeth in Allah) he believes in the word of Allah (and is true to the believers) and hebelieves the word of sincere believers, (and a mercy) preventing from torment (for such of you as believe)both inwardly and outwardly. (Those who vex the Messenger of Allah) by not joining him at the Battle ofTabuk. The reference here is to Jallas Ibn Suwayd, Sammak Ibn 'Amr, Mikhsha' Ibn Humayr and their host,(for them there is a painful doom) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.
9|62|(They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) to please you) about not joining you in the military expedition, (butAllah, with His messenger, hath more right that they should please Him if they are believers) if they weresincere in their faith.
9|63|(Know they not) i.e. Jallas and his host (that whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger) inwardly, (hisportion verily is hell, to abide therein? That is the extreme abasement) severe punishment.
9|64|(The hypocrites) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (fear lest a surah should be revealed) to their Prophet(concerning them, proclaiming) informing about (what is in their hearts) of hypocrisy. (Say) O Muhammad,to Wadi'ah Ibn Judham, Jadd Ibn Qays and Juhayr Ibn Humayr: (Scoff (your fill)) Muhammad (pbuh) andthe Qur'an! (Lo! Allah is disclosing what ye fear) what you conceal regarding Muhammad (pbuh) and hisCompanions.
9|65|(And if thou ask them) O Muhammad, about what they are laughing about (they will say: We did but talk)about the troop (and jest) and joke with each other. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (was it at Allah and Hisrevelations) the Qur'an (and His Messenger that ye did scoff?)
9|66|(Make no excuse) for what you said. (Ye have disbelieved after your (confession of) belief) while claimingyou are believers. (If We forgive a party of you) i.e. Juhayr Ibn Humayr because he did not make fun ofAllah or the Messenger but laughed with the others, (a party of you) Wadi'ah Ibn Judham and Jadd IbnQays (We shall punish because they have been guilty) because they were inwardly idolaters.
9|67|(The hypocrites, both men and women, proceed one from another) they follow inwardly each other'sreligion. (They enjoin the wrong) disbelief and opposition of the Messenger, (and they forbid the right) faithand compliance with the Messenger, (and they withhold their hands) from spending in works of goodness.(They forget Allah) they have left Allah's obedience inwardly, (so He hath forgotten them) He has forsakenthem in the life of this world and left them in the Hereafter in hell. (Lo! the hypocrites, they are thetransgressors) the disbelievers inwardly.
9|68|(Allah promiseth the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers fire of hell for their abode) i.e.dwelling therein. (It will suffice them) it will be their destiny. (Allah curseth them) Allah torments them, (andtheirs is lasting torment).

(And ye prate) speak falsehood (evenas they prated) and inwardly gave the lie to Muhammad (pbuh) just as those before them indulged infalsehood and gave the lie to the prophets of Allah. (Such are they whose works have perished) their goodworks have been thwarted (in the world and the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers) in that theywill face punishment.
9|70|(Hath not the fame) the news (of those before them reached them) how We destroyed them (the folk ofNoah) We destroyed them by drowning, ('Aad) the people of Hud, We destroyed them by the wind,(Thamud) the people of Salih, We destroyed them by means of the earthquake, (the folk of Abraham) Wedestroyed them by razing them down, (the dwellers of Midian) the people of Shu'ayb, We destroyed them bythe earthquake (and the disasters) the deniers who were swallowed up by the earth, i.e. the people of Lotwho were destroyed by being swallowed up by the earth and also by a rain of stones? (Their messengers(from Allah) came unto them with proofs) with commands and prohibitions as well as signs, but they refusedto believe in them and Allah destroyed them. (So Allah surely wronged them not) by destroying them, (butthey did wrong themselves) through disbelief and giving the lie to the prophets.
9|71|(And the believers, men and women, are protecting friends one of another) they follow the religion of oneanother inwardly and outwardly; (they enjoin the right) the confession of Allah's divine unity and thefollowing of Muhammad (pbuh) (and forbid the wrong) disbelief, idolatry and abstention from followingMuhammad (pbuh) (and they establish worship) they perform the five daily prayers (and they pay the poor-due) from their wealth, (and they obey Allah and His messenger) in secret and in the open.

9|74|(They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong)) Jallas Ibn Suwayd swore by Allah that he did not saywhat 'Amir Ibn Qays said he did, (yet they did say the word of disbelief) the word of the disbelieversbecause when the Prophet (pbuh) mentioned the defects of the hypocrites and their inward illnesses, JallasIbn Suwayd said: "by Allah, if Muhammad is true in what he says about our brothers, we are worse thanasses". When 'Amir Ibn Qays informed the Prophet (pbuh) Jallas swore by Allah that he did not say this. ButAllah gave him the lie and said (yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after theirSurrender (to Allah). And they purposed that which they could not attain) they wanted to expel and kill theMessenger without success, (and they sought revenge) they could not find anything wrong with the Prophet(pbuh) and his Companions (only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty) throughthe spoils of war. (If they repent) from disbelief and hypocrisy (it will be better for them) than disbelief andhypocrisy; (and if they turn away) from repentance, (Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the worldand the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend) who will protect them (nor helper in the earth) toprevent them from that which is wanted with them.
9|75|(And of them) i.e. of the hypocrites (is he who made a covenant with Allah) he who swore by Allah, thereference here is to Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah ((saying): If He give us of His bounty) the wealth that he has inHistoric Syria (We will give alms) for the sake of Allah's religion: we shall give from it what is due to Allahand will use it to keep our ties of kinship (and become of the righteous) of the thankful.
9|76|(Yet when He gave them of His bounty) of the wealth which was in Historic Syria, (they hoarded it) theyfailed to give the right due to Allah as they had promised (and turned away) from their promise, (averse)denying;
9|77|(So He hath made the consequence (to be) hypocrisy in their hearts) his end was that Allah cast hypocrisy inhis heart (until the day when they shall meet Him) until the day of Judgement, (because they broke theirword to Allah that they promised Him) because of breaking his promise, (and because they lied) andbecause he lied about what he said.
9|78|(Know they not) i.e. the hypocrites (that Allah knoweth both their secret) that which is between them (andthe thought that they confide) when they are alone, (and that Allah is the Knower of Things Hidden) fromHis servants?

This refers to Abu 'Uqayl 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn Tijan who could notfind anything to give for alms except a measure of dates, (and deride them) because of the little alms hegave. The hypocrites said about him: he did not bring this except that he wished to be mentioned and begiven more alms than he gave himself, (Allah (Himself) derideth them) on the day of Judgement. (Theirs willbe a painful doom) in the Hereafter.
9|80|(Ask forgiveness for them (O Muhammad)) Allah says: if you ask forgiveness for 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, JaddIbn Qays, and Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and their followers-who were about 70 men-, (or ask not forgiveness forthem) it is all the same for them; (though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgivethem) that punishment.

9|81|(Those who were left behind rejoiced) the hypocrites were pleased (at sitting still) at staying behind and notjoining the battle of Tabuk (behind the Messenger of Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth andtheir lives in Allah's way) in obedience of Allah.

9|117|(Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet) Allah has forgiven the Prophet, (and to the Muhajirin and theAnsar) as He has forgiven the Emigrants and the Helpers who prayed towards the two Qiblahs and hadparticipated in the Battle of Badr.

(But canst thou) O Muhammad(make the deaf to hear even though they apprehend not) even though they have no desire to apprehend?
10|43|(And of them) of the Jews; and it is said: of the idolaters (is he who looketh towards you. But canst thouguide) lead to guidance (the blind even though they see not) even though they do not desire to see theTruth and guidance?
10|44|(Lo! Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught) He neither decreases their good works nor increases their evildeeds; (but mankind wrong themselves) through disbelief, idolatry and transgressions.
10|45|(And on the day when He shall gather them) i.e. the Jews, the Christians and the idolaters (together, (whenit will seem) as though they had tarried) in their graves (but an hour of the day, recognizing one another)recognising one another in some places and not recognising one another in others, (those will verily haveperished) have lost (who denied the meeting with Allah) who denied resurrection after death, because theyhave lost both this world and the Next (and were not guided) from disbelief and error.
10|46|(Whether We let thee) O Muhammad (behold something of that which We promise them) of chastisement(or (whether We) cause thee to die) before We show you, O Muhammad, that which We promise them ofchastisement, (still unto Us is their return) after they die, (and Allah, moreover, is Witness over what theydo) of good and evil.
10|47|(And for every nation) for the adherents of each religion (there is a messenger) who calls them to Allah andto His religion. (And when their messenger cometh) to them and they deny (it will be judged between them)and the Messenger (fairly) with justice: those people will perish and the Messenger will be saved, (and theywill not be wronged) their good works will not be decreased nor will their evil deeds be increased.
10|48|(And they say) and the adherents of each religion say to their messenger: (When will this promise) that youhave promised us (be fulfilled, if ye are truthful?)
10|49|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I have no power to) avoid (hurt or) bring (benefit) to (myself, save thatwhich Allah willeth) of hurt or benefit. (For every nation there is an appointed time) a respite anddetermined time. (When their time cometh) when the time of their destruction comes, (then they cannot putit off an hour) after the appointed time, (nor hasten (it)) before the appointed time.
10|50|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Have ye thought: When His doom) Allah's chastisement(cometh unto you as a raid by night, or in the (busy) day) what you will do? (what is there of it) of Allah'schastisement (that the guilty ones) the idolaters (desire to hasten?) and then say: we believe.
10|51|Say to them, O Muhammad: (Is it (only) then, when it hath befallen you) when the punishment has befallenyou, (that you will believe?) They said: "Yes!" Say to them, O Muhammad, that it is said to them: (What!(Believe) now) in the punishment, (when (until now) ye have been hastening it) the punishment (on(through disbelief)) out of mockery?
10|52|(Then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly) the idolaters: (Taste the torment of eternity. Are yerequited) in the Hereafter (aught save what ye used to earn) do and say in the life of this world?
10|53|(And they ask thee) O Muhammad (to inform them) i.e. about the punishment and the Qur'an ((saying): Is ittrue) i.e. the punishment and the Qur'an? (Say: Yea, by my Lord) say: yes, by my Lord, (verily it is true) thepunishment will truly happen, (and ye cannot escape) Allah's punishment.
10|54|(And if each soul that doeth wrong) that ascribes partners to Allah (had all that is in the earth it would seekto ransom itself therewith) it would ransom itself from Allah's punishment; (and they will feel remorse withinthem) the leaders will conceal their remorse from the lowly among people, (when they see the doom) whenthey see the chastisement. (But it hath been judged between them) and the lowly among people (fairly)with justice (and they are not wronged) none of their good works will be diminished and none of their evildeeds will be increased.
10|55|(Lo! verily all that is in the heavens and the earth) of created beings and marvels (is Allah's. Lo! verily Allah'spromise is true) resurrection after death will truly take place. (But most of them know not) most of them donot believe.
10|56|(He quickeneth) upon the Resurrection (and giveth death) in the life of this world, (and unto Him ye will bereturned) after death.
10|57|(O mankind!) O people of Mecca! (There hath come unto you an exhortation) a warning (from your Lord)regarding that which you are now in, (a balm) an exposition (for that which is in the breasts) of blindness,(a guidance) from error (and a mercy) which brings relief from punishment (for believers).
10|58|(Say) O Muhammad, to your Companions: (In the bounty of Allah) in the Qur'an with which Allah hashonoured you (and in His mercy) the religion of Islam, which Allah has given you success to follow: (therein)i.e. in the Qur'an and Islam (let them rejoice. It is better) i.e. the Qur'an and Islam (than what they hoard)is better than what the Jews and idolaters amass of wealth.
10|59|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Have ye considered what provision) what crops and cattle(Allah hath sent down for you) Allah has created for you, (how ye have made of it lawful) for men (andunlawful) for women: i.e. the benefit of al-Bahirah, al-Sa'ibah and al-Ham? (Say) to them, O Muhammad:(Hath Allah permitted you) has Allah commanded this, (or do ye invent a lie concerning Allah) indeed youare inventing lies?
10|60|(And what think those who invent a lie concerning Allah) He will do with them (upon the Day ofResurrection? Lo! Allah truly is Bountiful) favourable (towards mankind) by delaying His punishment, (butmost of them give not thanks) for it nor do they believe.
10|61|(And thou art not) O Muhammad (occupied with any business) any matter (and thou recitest not) on them(a lecture from this (Scripture)) a surah or a verse, (and ye (mankind) perform no act) whether good or evil,(but We are Witness) but We have knowledge (of you) and of your matter, recitation and works (when yeare engaged therein) i.e. in the Qur'an and its denial. (And not an atom's weight) of the servants' works (inthe earth or in the sky escapeth) is hidden from (your Lord, nor what is less) nor what is lighter (than thator greater than that) or heavier, (but it is (written) in a clear Book) but it is written in the Guarded Tablet.
10|62|(Lo! verily the) believing (friends of Allah are (those) on whom fear (cometh) not) regarding any futurepunishment, (nor do they grieve) about that which they have left behind.
10|63|Allah then showed who these are, saying: (Those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (andkeep their duty (to Allah)) and ward off disbelief, idolatry, and indecencies.
10|64|(Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world) through good dream visions which they see or are seen intheir favour (and in the Hereafter) by entering Paradise. (There is no changing the Words of Allah) that theywill enter Paradise (that) good tiding (is the Supreme Triumph) the abounding salvation: they earn Paradiseand all that is in it and are saved from hell and all that is in it.
10|65|(And let not their speech) their denial of you (grieve thee) O Muhammad. (Lo! Power) might and invincibility(belongeth wholly to Allah) Who is able to destroy them. (He is the Hearer) of what they say, (the Knower)of what they do as well as of their punishment.
10|66|(Lo! is it not unto Allah that belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth) ofcreated beings and He changes them as He wills? (Those who follow) worship (aught instead of Allah follownot) worship not ((His) partners) gods in the form of idols. (They follow) they worship (only a conjecture) bymeans of conjecture, and have no certainty (and they) i.e. the leaders of the disbelievers (do but guess)they lie to those who are lowly among them.
10|67|(He it is) i.e. it is your Lord (who hath appointed) created (for you the night that you should rest therein andthe day giving sight) and the day bright and clear so that you are able to come and go. (Lo! Herein) in thatwhich I have mentioned (verily are portents) lessons (for a folk that heed) the admonitions of the Qur'anand who also obey.
10|68|(They) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: Allah hath taken (unto Him) a son) from the female angels. (Glorifiedbe He!) Allah exonerates Himself from having sons or partners. (He hath no needs!) He has no need for ason or partners. (His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) of created beings and marvels.(Ye have no warrant) you have neither scripture nor proof (for this. Tell ye) indeed, you are saying(concerning Allah that which you know not) of lies?
10|69|(Say) O Muhammad: (Verily those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed) they will not escapeAllah's punishment nor will they be safe.
10|70|(This world's portion (will be theirs)) they will live in the life of this world a little, (then unto Us is theirreturn) after they die. (Then We make them taste a dreadful) a severe (doom because they used todisbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an and also because they invented lies about Allah.
10|71|(Recite unto them the story of Noah) in the Qur'an, (when he told his people: O my people! If my sojourn(here)) if my extended stay with you (and my reminding you) and my warning of you (by Allah's revelations)from the punishment of Allah (are an offence unto you, in Allah have I put my trust) I rely in and consignmy matter to Allah, (so decide upon your course of action) unite upon one decision and one matter, (youand your partners) and seek the help of your idols. (Let not your course of action be in doubt for you) donot make your decision and matter too vague for yourselves. (Then come forth against me, give me norespite) do not wait.
10|72|(But if ye are averse) from believing in that which I brought (I have asked of you) in exchange for believing(no wage) no payment. (My wage) my reward for calling you to believe (is the concern of Allah only, and Iam commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him)) and to follow His religion.
10|73|(But they denied him) i.e. they denied that which Noah had brought them, (so We saved him) fromdrowning (and those) believers who were (with him in the ship, and made them vicegerents) and inhabitantsof the earth, (while We drowned those who denied Our revelations) We drowned those who denied OurScripture and Messenger Noah. (See then) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence for those who hadbeen warned) the end result of those who were warned by the messengers but did not believe.
10|74|(Then, after him) after the destruction of the folk of Noah, (We sent messengers unto their folk, and theybrought them clear proofs) commands, prohibitions and signs. (But they were not ready to believe in thatwhich they denied before) i.e. on the day of the covenant. (Thus print) seal (We on the hearts of thetransgressors) who engage in the prohibited instead of the lawful.
10|75|(Then, after them) after these messengers, (We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Ourrevelations) with Our Scripture; it is also said that this means: with Our nine signs: the hand, the staff, thedeluge, the locusts, lice, frogs, blood, drought and shortage of harvests; it is also said that the revelationshere mean: obliteration, (but they were arrogant) deeming themselves above faith, the Scripture, theMessenger and the revelations (and were a guilty folk) and were idolaters.
10|76|(And when the Truth) the Scripture, the Messenger and the revelations (from Our presence came untothem, they said: This) what Moses has brought (is mere magic) is a manifest lie; and according to adifferent reading this means: Moses is a lying sorcerer.
10|77|(Moses said) to them: (Speak ye (so) of the Truth) the Scripture, Messenger and revelations (when it hathcome unto you? Is this magic? Now magicians thrive not) they have neither escape nor safety from Allah'schastisement.
10|78|(They said) to Moses: (Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that (faith) in which we found ourfathers) of idol worship, (and that you two may own the place of greatness) sovereignty and power (in theland) of Egypt? (We will not believe you two).
10|79|(And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning) every skilful (wizard unto me).
10|80|(And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast) cast your staffs and ropes!
10|81|(And when they had cast) their staffs and ropes, (Moses said) to them: (That which ye have brought) thatwhich you have cast (is magic. Lo! Allah will make it vain) Allah will make it void. (Lo! Allah upholdeth not)Allah is not pleased with (the work of mischief-makers) of sorcerers.
10|82|(And Allah will vindicate) Allah will manifest for His religion (the Truth by His words) vindication, (howevermuch the guilty be averse) even though the idolaters dislike this.
10|83|(But none trusted) none believed (Moses, save some scions of his people) from the people of Pharaoh: theirfathers were Copts and their mothers were Israelites, and so they believed in Moses, ((and they were) infear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, that they would persecute them) kill them. (Lo! Pharaoh was verily atyrant) a foe (in the land) to the religion of Moses, (and Lo! he verily was of the wanton) he was of theidolaters.
10|84|(And Moses said: O my people! If you have believed in Allah then put trust in Him, if ye have indeedsurrendered (unto Him)) because you have indeed surrendered to Allah!
10|85|(They said: In Allah we put trust. Our Lord! Oh, make us not a lure for the wrong-doing folk) for theidolaters, i.e. do not give them mastery over us lest they think themselves to be followers of the Truth andus followers of falsehood;
10|86|(And, of Thy mercy, save us from the folk that disbelieve) from Pharaoh and his folk.
10|87|(And We inspired Moses and his brother) Aaron, ((saying): Appoint houses) places of worship in the interiorof your houses (for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories) faced towards the direction ofprayer, (and establish worship) perform the five daily prayers. (And give good news to the believers) thatthey shall obtain triumph, salvation and Paradise.
10|88|(And Moses said: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lo! Thou hast given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour) beauty(and riches) and abundant riches (in the life of the world, Our Lord!) O our Lord! (that they may lead menastray) that by means of it they may lead your servants astray (from Thy way) from Your religion andobedience. (Our Lord! Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not) so that they willnot believe (till they see the painful doom) their own drowning.
10|89|(He said) Allah said to Moses and Aaron: (Your prayer is heard. Do ye twain keep to the straight path) offaith, obedience of Allah and conveyance of the message, (and follow not the road) the religion (of thosewho have no knowledge) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and do not believe in Him. The reference here isto Pharaoh and his folk.
10|90|(And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts pursued them inrebellion) with their words (and transgression) with the intention of killing them, (till, when the (fate of)drowning overtook him, he exclaimed: I believe that there is no God save Him in whom the Children ofIsrael) Moses and his companions (believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto Him)) following theirreligion.
10|91|The Archangel Gabriel said to him: (What! Now!) will you believe now upon drowning (When hitherto)before this drowning (thou hast rebelled) disbelieved in Allah (and been of the wrong-doers) in the land ofEgypt, killing, associating partners with Allah and calling for the worship of other than Allah?
10|92|(But this day We save thee in your body) We save your cadaver in its armour (that thou mayst be a portent)that you may be a lesson, such that they do not claim what you claimed and know that you are not a god(for those after thee) among the disbelievers. (Lo! most of mankind) i.e. the disbelievers (are heedless of)are deniers of (Our portents) Our Scripture and Messenger.
10|93|(And We verily did allot unto) We verily did send to (the Children of Israel a fixed abode) a noble land:Jordan and Palestine, (and did provide them with good things) honey, quails and spoils of war (and theydiffered not) i.e. the Jews and Christians regarding Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (until knowledge) theexposition of what is their Scriptures about the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (came untothem. Lo! your Lord) O Muhammad (will judge between them) between the Jews and Christians (on the Dayof Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ) regarding religion.
10|94|(And if thou) O Muhammad (art in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto thee) concerning that withwhich We sent Gabriel, i.e. the Qur'an, (then question those who read the Scripture) i.e. the Torah ((thatwas) before you) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers. The Prophet (pbuh) did not ask nor was he ever indoubt about the Qur'an. Rather, Allah was addressing with these words the people of the Prophet. (Verilythe Truth from thy Lord) i.e. Gabriel with the Qur'an from your Lord, containing the events of past nations(hath come unto thee) O Muhammad. (So be not thou of the waverers) be not of the doubters.
10|95|(And be not thou of those who deny the revelations of Allah) Allah's Book and Messenger, (for then wertthou of the losers)
10|96|(Lo! those for whom the word of your Lord) that they will be punished (hath effect) has been enjoined (willnot believe) as it is in Allah's foreknowledge,
10|97|(Though every token) they asked you to provide (come unto them) they will not believe, (till they see thepainful doom) the Day of Badr, Uhud and the day of the confederates.
10|98|(If only there had been a community (of all those that were destroyed of old) that believed) if only thepeople of a township believed when the punishment befell them (and profited by its belief) He says: theirfaith did not benefit them upon the descent of punishment (as did the folk of Jonah) except the folk ofJonah who benefited from their belief. (When they believed We drew off) We diverted (from them thetorment of disgrace) the severe punishment (in the life of the world and gave them comfort for a while) Weleft them without punishment until they died.
10|99|(And if thy Lord willed) O Muhammad, (all who are in the earth would have believed together) all thedisbelievers would have believed. (Wouldst thou (Muhammad) compel men) would you coerce people (untilthey are believers) to become believers?
10|100|(It is not for any) disbelieving (soul to believe) in Allah (save by the permission of Allah) save by Allah's willand given success. (He hath set uncleanness) He leaves denial (upon those) in the hearts of those (whohave no sense) who do not apprehend Allah's divine Oneness. This verse was revealed about Abu Talib. TheProphet (pbuh) was so keen that he believes, but Allah did not want him to believe.
10|101|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Behold what is in the heavens): the sun, the moon and the stars (and theearth) what is in the earth: the trees, beasts, mountains and oceans! These are all signs for you. (Butrevelations and warnings) the messengers (avail not folk who will not believe) as it is in Allah'sforeknowledge.
10|102|(What expect they) is there any sign left for them (save the like of the days of those who passed away)except the punishment of those who passed away (before them) among the disbelievers? (Say) OMuhammad: (Expect then!) the descent of punishment and my own destruction! (I am with you among theexpectant) of the descent of punishment and destruction upon you.
10|103|(Then shall We save Our messengers and the believers) in these messengers after the destruction of theirpeople, (in like manner (as of old)) thus. (It is incumbent upon Us to save believers) with their messengers.
10|104|(Say) O Muhammad: (O mankind!) O people of Mecca (If ye are in doubt of my religion) Islam, (then (knowthat) I worship not those whom ye worship) those upon whom you call, of idols, (instead of Allah, but Iworship Allah who causeth you to die) Allah who takes away your souls and brings you back to life after Hemakes you die, (and I have been commanded to be of the believers) with the believers, following their faith.
10|105|(And, set thy purpose resolutely for religion) make your religion and works sincere to Allah, (as a man bynature upright) surrendered to Allah, (and be not of those who ascribe partners (to Allah)) do not be amongthe idolaters, following their religion.
10|106|(And cry not) worship not, (beside Allah, unto that which cannot profit thee) in the life of this world or in theHereafter if you were to worship it (nor hurt thee) if you did not worship it, (for if thou didst so) for if youworshipped it (then wert thou of the wrong-doers) of those who harm themselves.
10|107|(If Allah afflicteth thee with some hurt) with hardship or a disliked matter, (there is none who can remove it)i.e. the harm (save Him; and if He desireth) and if He bestows upon you (good for thee) a blessing orpleasant matter, (there is none who can repel His bounty) there is none who can stop His gift, (He strikethwith it) He favours with His bounty (whom He will of His bondmen) whoever deserves it. (He is theForgiving) He forgives those who repent, (the Merciful) towards those who die in a state of repentance.
10|108|(Say: O mankind!) O people of Mecca! (Now hath the Truth) the Scripture and Messenger (from your Lordcome unto you. So whosoever is guided) by the Scripture and Messenger, (is guided only for (the good of)his soul) i.e. its reward goes to him, (and whosoever erreth) and whoever disbelieves in the Scripture andMessenger (erreth only against it) i.e. the onus of his disbelief goes to him. (And I am not a warder) atrustee (over you). This was abrogated by the verse of fighting.
10|109|(And) O Muhammad (follow that which is inspired in thee) that which you are commanded in the Qur'anregarding the conveyance of the message, (and forbear) in this conveyance (until Allah give judgement)until Allah judges between them and you, i.e. through their killing and destruction on the Day of Badr. (AndHe is the Best of Judges) He is the strongest of Judges: He is able to destroy them and make youtriumphant'.
11|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in explanation of the word of Allah (Alif.Lam. Ra.): '(Alif. Lam. Ra.) Allah says: I am Allah, I see; as it is said that this is an oath by which Allahswore. ((This is) a Scripture) i.e. the Qur'an (the revelations whereof are perfected) expositing the lawfuland the prohibited, the commands and prohibitions (and then exposited) and then elucidated. ((It cometh)from One Wise) Who has ruled that none should be worshiped but He, (Informed) of he who worships andhim who worships not,

(He will cause you to enjoy) He will make youlive (a fair estate) free of chastisement (until a time appointed) i.e. death. (He giveth His bounty) in Islam(unto every bountiful one) his reward in the Hereafter. (But if ye turn away) from faith and repentance, (Lo!(then) I fear for you) I know that you shall incur (the retribution of an awful) a tremendous (Day).

11|5|(Lo! now they) i.e. Akhnas Ibn Shurayq and his followers (fold up their breasts) conceal in their hearts theirhatred and enmity for Muhammad (pbuh) (that they may hide from him) that they may hide fromMuhammad (pbuh) their hatred and enmity by keeping his company and pretending to him that they lovehim. (At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing) at the moment they cover theirheads with their clothes, (Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden) among themselves as well as thatwhich they conceal in their hearts (and that which they proclaim) of fighting and antipathy; it is also saidthat this refers to that which they proclaim of love and keeping company. (Lo! He is Aware of what is in thebreasts (of men)) whether it is good or evil.

11|7|(And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days) six days of the beginning of this world:each day the equivalent of one thousand years, the first day being Sunday and the last Friday (and HisThrone) before the creation of the heavens and earth (was upon the water) and Allah was before theThrone and before water (that He might try you) that He may test you in the interval between life anddeath, (which of you is best in conduct) which of you is more sincere in his works. (Yet if thou (OMuhammad) sayst) to the people of Mecca: (Lo! ye will be raised again) you will be brought back to lifeagain (after death! those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (will surely say: This) which Muhammad(pbuh) is saying (is naught but mere magic) manifest lies which will never happen.

11|12|(A likely thing, that thou) O Muhammad (wouldst forsake aught of that which hath been revealed unto thee)that which you were commanded in the Qur'an of conveying the message and of reviling and denigratingtheir idols, (and that thy breast should be straitened for it) and that you are annoyed with what you werecommanded, (because they say) because the disbelievers of Mecca say: (Why hath not a treasure) wealthfrom heaven (been sent down for him) for Muhammad to support himself with, (or an angel come with him)to testify in his favour? (Thou art) O Muhammad (but a warner) a warning Messenger, (and Allah is incharge) Allah is Custodian; it is also said this means: witness (of all things) of their saying and chastisement.
11|13|(Or they say) Nay, the disbelievers of Mecca say: (He hath invented it) Muhammad has invented the Qur'anand presented it to us.

11|14|When they could not respond, Allah said: (And if they answer not your prayer) and if the wrong-doers donot answer you, (then know) O disbelievers (that it is revealed) that Gabriel brought down the Qur'an (onlyin the knowledge of Allah) and with his command; (and that there is no God save Him.

The ship was300 cubits (the measure of his arm) long, 50 cubits wide, and its height 30 cubits. It had three decks, someof which were lower than others. In the lower deck, he put beasts of prey and reptiles; in the intermediatedeck wild animals and beasts; and in the higher deck people who were 80 in number: 40 men and 40women.

12|17|(Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another) and hunting, (and left Joseph by our things) toguard them, (and the wolf devoured him) as you said, (and thou believest not our sayings even when wespeak the Truth).
12|18|(And they came with false blood on his shirt) they stained his shirt with the blood of a goat.

12|19|(And there came a caravan) of travellers from Midian who were going to Egypt. They lost their way andwent round and round until they passed by the land where the pit was. This land is called Dawthan, midwaybetween Midian and Egypt, and there the caravan decided to have a break, (and they sent their water-drawer) each group of people sent their water-drawer. The pit in which Joseph was thrown was the lot of anArab man from Midian called Malik Ibn Du'ar who was the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb, Allah give himpeace. (He let down his pail (into the pit)) and Joseph got hold of it such that the water-drawer could notpull it back. When he looked down he saw a boy grabbing the pail of water and so he called his companions.(He said: Good luck!) "This is my good luck, O my companions!" His companions asked him: "what is it, OMalik?" He said: (Here is a youth) the most handsome of youths. They gathered and got Joseph out of thepit. (And they hid him as a treasure) they concealed from their people the fact that they found him in thepit, and instead informed them that the owners of the pit entrusted them to sell him in Egypt for them (andAllah was Aware of what they did) to Joseph, i.e. what the brothers of Joseph did to him; it is also said thatthis refers to the people of the caravan.
12|20|(And they sold him) the brothers of Malik Ibn Du'ar bought him (for a low price) by cheating in weight; it isalso said that he was bought with false money; and it was also said that he was bought with unlawfulmoney, (a number of silver coins) 20 silver coins; it is also said: 32 silver coins; (and they attached no valueto him) they were reluctant to buy him because they did not need him; it is also said that the brothers ofJoseph attached no importance to Joseph because they did not know his standing and stature with Allah,Exalted is He. It is also said that the people of the caravan attached no value to Joseph.
12|21|(And he of Egypt) the Chief Official, who was the treasurer of the king and the chief of his soldiers. Hisname was Potiphar (Qitfir) (who purchased him said unto his wife) Zelicha (Zulaykha): Receive himhonourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us) in our farm (or we may adopt him as a son). This manbought Joseph for the price of 20 silver coins, a garment and a pair of sandals. (Thus We establishedJoseph) We gave him authority (in the land) of Egypt (that We might teach him the interpretation of events)the interpretation of dreams. (And Allah was predominant in his career) Allah is dominant in things destined;no one can repel His destined things, (but most of mankind) the people of Egypt (know not) nor believe; it isalso said that this means: most do not know that Allah is dominant in the things that He destined.
12|22|(And when he reached his prime) between 18 and 30 years old (We gave him wisdom and knowledge)understanding and prophethood. (Thus We reward the good) in speech and works, in knowledge andwisdom.
12|23|(And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors) on her and Joseph (andsaid) to Joseph: (Come!) I am yours. (He said) Joseph said: (I seek refuge in Allah!) from such a thing. (Lo!he is my lord) The Chief Official, (who hath treated me honourably) in contrast to his own brothers. (Wrong-doers never prosper) adulterers will never be safe from or escape Allah's chastisement.
12|24|(She) the woman (verily desired him, and he) Joseph (would have desired her if it had not been that he sawthe argument of his Lord) if he had not seen that the chastisement of his Lord would befall him; it is alsosaid that this means: if he had not seen the figure of his father; and it is also said that this means: if he hadnot seen the proof of his Lord. (Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness) adultery.(Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves) who are protected from adultery.
12|25|(And they raced with one another to the door) Joseph wanting to leave and her wanting to lock the door.The woman got there first (and she tore his shirt) in two (from behind) from the waist to his feet, (and theymet her lord and master) the husband of the woman; and it is said: her cousin (at the door. She said) thewoman said to her husband: (What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil) adultery (to your folk, save prisonor a painful doom) be severely beaten?
12|26|((Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act) it is her who called me and offered herself to me.(And in witness of her own folk testified) a man taken as judge from her own people, her brother and it issaid her cousin, pronounced: (If his shirt) the shirt of Joseph (is torn from before) from the front, (then shespeaketh truth) then the woman has spoken the Truth (and he is of the liars).
12|27|(And if his shirt is torn from behind) from the back, (then she hath lied) then the woman has lied (and he isof the Truthful) that she invited him to her.
12|28|(So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said) her brother said: (Lo! this is of the guile) the schemingand devising (of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great) it touches the innocent and the sick.
12|29|Her brother then said to Joseph: (O Joseph! Turn away from this) and do not inform anyone. And then heturned to the woman and said: (and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin) seek your husband'sforgiveness for your act. (Lo! thou art of the sinful) you cheated your husband.
12|30|However, the news of this incident spread in the city, (And women in the city) they were four women: thewife of the king's cupbearer, the wife of the king's head of prisons, the wife of the king's cook and the wifeof the man in charge of the king's stable (said: The ruler's wife) Zelicha (is asking of her slave boy an illdeed) wants her slave boy to sleep with her. (Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We beholdher in plain aberration) she is plainly wrong in her love of her slave boy.
12|31|(And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them) an invitation (and prepared for them a cushionedcouch) to lie on and then she had meat and bread brought to them (and gave to every one of them a knife)for they did not eat of meat except that which they could cut with their knives (and said) Zelicha said toJoseph: (Come out unto them!) O Joseph! (And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands,exclaiming: Allah Blameless!) Allah forbid! (This is not a human being. This is no other than some graciousangel) gracious in the sight of his Lord.
12|32|(She said) Zelicha said to them: (This is he on whose account you blamed me) and vilified me. (I asked ofhim an evil act) I wanted him to sleep with me, (but he proved continent) but he refused out of continence,(but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall him of those brought low) he willbe humiliated in prison.
12|33|These women said to Joseph. "Obey your mistress!" (He said) Joseph said: (O my Lord! Prison is more dearthan that unto which they urge me) of adultery, (and if Thou fend not off their wiles) their scheming (fromme I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish) who ignore Your blessing; it is also said that thefoolish here refer to adulterers.
12|34|(So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer) of prayers, (Knower) ofHis answer; it is also said Hearer of the ladies' talk and Knower of their scheming.
12|35|(And it seemed good to them) to the Chief Official (after they had seen the signs (of his innocence)) the tornshirt and the judgement of her brother (to imprison him for a time) a few years; it is also said that (for atime) means: until people stopped talking about it.
12|36|(And two young men) two slaves of the king: his cupbearer and his cook-he got angry with them and putthem in prison-(went to prison with him) they stayed together five years. (One of them), the cupbearer,(said: I dreamed that I was pressing wine) pressing grapes to make wine and giving it to the king. Thiscupbearer saw in a dream that he entered a vineyard and there he saw a pleasant bough with threeoffshoots and on the offshoots bunches of grapes. He picked the grapes, pressed them and gave it to theKing. Joseph said: "As for the vineyard, it is the job you had; the bough represents the expertise you have inyour job; its pleasantness represents your position and merit in that job. The three offshoots mean that youwill be released in three days and shall return to your job. The pressed grapes you gave to the king meansthat he will give you your job back, honour you and treat you well". (The other) the cook, who prepared theking's bread (said I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating) he sawin his dream that he was coming out of the king's kitchen carrying on his head three baskets of bread whenbirds came and ate from the bread on the baskets. Joseph said: "You have seen an evil thing. As for yourgoing out of the King's kitchen, this means that you will lose your job; the three baskets means that you willstay in prison for three days. The birds eating from the baskets means that the king will get you out ofprison in three days to crucify you and the birds will eat of your head". Before Joseph interpreted theirdreams for them, the two men said to him: (Announce unto us the interpretation) interpret for us ourdreams, (for we see thee of those good) towards the prisoners; it is also said that this means: you are ofthose who are truthful in their speech.
12|37|(He said) Joseph said to them, because he wanted to inform them about his knowledge of interpretingdreams: (The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation)i.e. of its colour and type (ere it cometh unto you) so can I fail to interpret your dreams? (This) theinterpretation of dreams (is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk) Idid not follow the religion of a people (who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in) they are deniers of(the Hereafter) resurrection after death.
12|38|(And I have followed the religion of my fathers) I held firm to the religion of my forefathers, (Abraham andIsaac and Jacob. It never was for us) it was not permissible for us (to attribute aught) any idols (as partnerto Allah. This) pure Religion, prophethood and Islam with which Allah has honoured us (is of the bounty ofAllah unto us) a blessing that Allah blessed us with (and unto mankind) by sending us to them; it is also saidthat this means: this is a bounty unto the believers through the blessing of faith; (but most men) the peopleof Egypt (give not thanks) do not believe in this.
12|39|(O my two fellow prisoners!) He said this to the prison master as well as to the prisoners (Are diverse lordsbetter) is the worship of numerous gods better, (or Allah the One, the Almighty?) or the worship of Allah,the One Who has no son or partner, the All-Conquering over His created beings.
12|40|(Those whom ye worship beside Him) besides Allah (are but names) lifeless idols (which ye have named, yeand your fathers) you and your fathers called them gods. (Allah hath revealed no sanction) no Scripture orproof (for them) for your worship of them.

(This) profession of divine Oneness (is the right religion) the establishedReligion that He is pleased with: i.e. Islam, (but most men) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believein it.
12|41|Joseph them proceeded to interpret the dreams of the two prisoners, saying: (O my two fellow prisoners! Asfor one of you) the cupbearer, he will return to his former position and glory, (he will pour out wine for hislord) his master the king (to drink; and as for the other) the baker, he will leave prison, and (he will becrucified so that the birds will eat from his head) the two prisoner were alarmed upon hearing theinterpretation of the baker's dream. Both of them hastened to say: "We have not seen any dreams!" ButJoseph said to them: (Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire) it will be just as I haveinformed you, whether you saw those dreams or not.
12|42|(And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released) from prison, i.e. the cupbearer:(Mention me in the presence of thy lord) your master the king; tell him that I have been wronged: mybrothers sold me when I being a free man and I was put into prison while being innocent. (But Satan causedhim to forget to mention it to his lord) Satan made him so preoccupied that he forgot to mention Joseph tohis master, the king. It is also said that this means: Satan whispered to him: if you mention prison to theking, he will put you back in it. This is why he did not mention Joseph to the king; it is also said that themeaning of this is: Satan made Joseph forget the remembrance of his Lord and instead remembered acreated being like him, (so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years) seven years, as a punishment fornot mentioning Allah, when he had already spent five years in jail.
12|43|(And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine) coming out of a river (which seven lean wereeating) the seven lean kine, that were dying of lack of nourishment swallowed up the fat kine, but even thenit was as if they did not eat anything, (and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry) the dry onescoiling around the green ones such that they overshadowed their greenery and became unnoticeable. (Onotables!) Meaning: the soothsayers, sorcerers and fortune-tellers, (Expound for me my vision) interpret forme my dream, (if ye can interpret dreams) if you know how to interpret dreams.
12|44|(They) i.e. the soothsayers, sorcerers and fortune-tellers (answered: Jumbled dreams!) these are false andunreal dreams. (And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams) we do not know how to interpretdreams.
12|45|(And he of the two who was released) from prison, i.e. the cupbearer, (and (now) at length) after sevenyears (remembered) remembered Joseph, (said: I am going to announce unto you the interpretation) hesaid to the king: I will inform you of the interpretation of your dream, (therefore send me forth) to prison forthere is a man there who knows the interpretation of dreams. And he described Joseph's knowledge,clemency and goodness towards the prisoners and his expertise in interpreting dreams. And so he was sent.
12|46|When he went to him, he said: (Joseph! O thou truthful one!) O you who were truthful in interpreting thefirst dream, (Expound for us the seven fat kine) that came out of the river and (which seven lean) that weredying of lack of nourishment (were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry) coilingaround the seven green ears, overshadowing their greenery, (that I may return unto the people) to the king,(so that they may know) the interpretation of the king's dream. Joseph said: "Yes! I will interpret his dream.The seven fat kine are seven years of soil fertility, and the seven green ears represent abundance and lowprices during these seven years. The seven dying, lean kine represent years of drought while the seven dryears represent lack of foodstuff and high prices during these years".
12|47|Joseph then instructed them what to do. (He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual) each yearcontinuously, (but that which ye reap) of crops, (leave it in the ear) and do not thresh it, this is better for itspreservation, (all save a little which ye eat) all save the quantity which you need for your sustenance.
12|48|(Then after that) after the seven years of soil fertility (will come seven hard years) seven years of drought(which will devour all that ye have prepared for them) all that you have saved during the seven years of soilfertility, (save a little of that which ye have stored) kept aside.
12|49|(Then, after that) after the years of drought, (will come a year when the people) of Egypt (will haveplenteous crops) foodstuffs and rain (and when they will press) wine and oils.
12|50|The Messenger went back and informed the king of it. (And the King said: Bring him unto me) bring Josephto me. (And when the messenger) the cupbearer (came unto him) to Joseph and informed him that the kingwanted to see him, (he said) Joseph said to him: (Return unto thy lord) your master, the king (and ask himwhat was the case of the women) he said: go and ask the king to enquire about what really happened withthose women (who cut their hands) who slashed and grazed their hands. (Lo! my lord) my master (knoweththeir guile) their scheming and doing.
12|51|The messenger went back and informed the king who summoned the four women: the wife of hiscupbearer, the wife of his chief cook, the wife of the master of his stable and the wife of the Chief Official.These four women were the most powerful personalities after the king. (He (the king) (then sent for thosewomen and) said: What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph? They answered: Allah Blameless!)God forbid! (We know) we saw (no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the Truth is out) in favour ofJoseph; it is also said that this means: now is the time to tell the truth. (I asked of him an evil act) I offeredmyself to him, (and he is surely of the Truthful) that he did not ask an evil act of me.
12|52|Joseph said: (This, that he) the Chief Official (may know that I betrayed him not) regarding his wife (insecret) when he was away, (and that surely Allah guideth not) neither is He pleased with nor make right(the snare of the betrayers) the work of adulterers.
12|53|At this point Gabriel said to him: "Not even when you nearly went to her, O Joseph?" Joseph said: (I do notexculpate myself) I do not exonerate my heart from nearly going towards her. (Lo! the (human) soul) theheart (enjoineth) the body (unto evil) evil works, (save that whereon my Lord hath mercy) save those whomAllah protects. (My Lord is Forgiving) He pardons, (Merciful) regarding the fact that I nearly went towardsher.
12|54|(And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person) bring him so that I give him aprivileged position instead of the Chief Official. (And when he had talked with him) and interpreted hisdreams (he said) the king said to him: (Lo! thou art today in our presence) with us (established) you haveprestige and position (and trusted) with what is entrusted to you; it is also said: you are trusted with theposition that we give you.
12|55|(He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land) appoint me in charge of the treasury of Egypt (I am askilled custodian) I am skilled in its estimation and know the time when people go hungry; it is also said thatthis means: I am trustworthy regarding that with which you have entrusted me, and also know thelanguages of the strangers who come to you.
12|56|(Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land) the land of Egypt. (He was the owner of it) who could go in thisland (where be pleased. We reach with our mercy) with prophethood and Islam (whom We will) whoeverdeserves it. (We lose not) We thwart not (the reward of the good) the reward of the believers who do goodin their deeds and speech.
12|57|(And the reward of the Hereafter is better) than the reward of the life of this world, (for those who believe)in Allah and all the Scriptures and messengers (and ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry andindecencies.
12|58|(And Joseph's brethren came) to Egypt: there were ten of them (and presented themselves before him)before Joseph, (and he knew them) Joseph knew that they were his brothers (but they knew him not) theydid not know he was their brother.
12|59|(And when he provided them with their provision) when he measured for them the measure they wereentitled to have (he said: Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father) for you said that you had a halfbrother, from your father's side, who stayed behind with your father. (See you not that I fill up the measure)it is said that he means: I fill up the measure with my own hands (and I am the best of hosts?)
12|60|(And if ye bring him not unto me) your half brother from your father's side, (then there shall be no measurefor you with me) in the future, (nor shall ye draw near) again.
12|61|(They said: We will try to win him from his father) we will ask his father and try to entice his father to lethim come with us: (that we will surely do) we surely guarantee that we will bring him with us.
12|62|(He) Joseph (said unto his young men) his servants: (Place their merchandise) hide their money (in theirsaddlebags so that they may know it) such that they know the favour I am bestowing upon them; it is alsosaid that this means: such that they realise it is their money and bring it back to me, (when they go back totheir folk) when they go back to their father, (and so will come again) a second time.
12|63|(So when they went back to their father) in the land of Canaan (they said: O our father! The measure isdenied us) in the future if you do not send Benjamin with us, (so send with us our brother) Benjamin (thatwe may obtain the measure) so that he can buy a measure for himself; or: that we may buy a measure forhim, according to a different reading, (surely we will guard him well) we guarantee to bring him back to you.
12|64|(He said) Jacob said to them: (Can I entrust him) Benjamin (to you save as I entrusted his brother) Joseph(to you aforetime?) He said: can I really make you pledge and promise more than I did in the case of hisbrother Joseph (Allah is better at guarding) than you are, (and He is the Most Merciful of those who showmercy) and He is more Merciful towards him than his parents or brothers.
12|65|(And when they opened their belongings) their saddlebags (they discovered that their merchandise) themoney which was to pay for the merchandise they bought (had been returned to them) along with thefoodstuffs. (They said: O our father!) We are not lying about the kindness and generosity of the mantowards us; it is also said that this means: we have not requested this from him (What (more) can we ask?Here is our merchandise) the money we gave for the price of the merchandise (returned to us) with themerchandise. This only shows his kindness towards us. Their father said to them: the man is only testingyou, you must return the money to him. (We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother)Benjamin when we go and return, (and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load)) if he comes withus. (This is a light measure) because of which we shall be given more; it is also said that this means: this isa small thing that we are requesting from you.
12|66|(He said) their father said to them: (I will not send him with you) simply because of your mere talk (till yegive me an undertaking) a pledge (in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you aresurrounded) unless an accident from heaven befalls you; it is also said that this means: unless an accidentfrom heaven or from the earth descends upon you. (And when they gave him their undertaking) when theygave him their pledge in the name of Allah that they will bring him back (he said) Jacob said: (Allah is theWarden over what we say) Allah is a Witness over what we say; it is also said that this means: Allah isCustodian over what we say.
12|67|(And he said) to them: (O my sons! Go not in by one gate) do not go in through the same road; (go in bydifferent gates) go in by different roads. (I can naught avail you as against Allah) against Allah's decreeconcerning you. (Lo! the decision) the judgement regarding what is decreed for you (rests with Allah only.In Him do I put my trust) I delegate my matter and yours to Him, (and in Him let all the trusting put theirtrust) those who rely should rely on Him; it is also said that this means: the believers should put their trustin Allah. Here, Jacob feared the evil eye against his sons, because they were all seemly and handsome.
12|68|(And when they entered) Egypt (in the manner which their father had enjoined) as their father commandedthem, (it would have naught availed them as against Allah) against what Allah had decreed for them; (it wasbut a need of Jacob's soul) in Jacob's heart (which he thus satisfied) which he expressed; (and lo! He) i.e.Jacob (was a lord of knowledge) of remembrance (because We had taught him) of that which We taughthim of legal rulings, punishments, decree and destiny; he knew that nothing happens except what Allahdecrees; (but most of mankind) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it.
12|69|(And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother) from both his father and mother (unto himself)he gave audience to his brother Benjamin and made his other brothers wait, (saying: Lo! I, even I, am yourbrother) in the position of your deceased brother, (therefore sorrow not) do not be saddened (for what theydid) for the alienation, insults and vilification you face from your brothers.
12|70|(And when he provided them with their provision) when he measured for them their provision, (he put thedrinking cup in his brother's saddlebag) he hid his drinking cup which he also used for measurement in thesaddlebag of his brother Benjamin. He then ordered them to leave and when they left he sent a youth afterthem, (and then a crier cried) the youth that Joseph sent cried: (O camel riders!) O people of the caravan(You are surely thieves!)
12|71|(They cried, coming towards them: What is it ye have lost?) what is it that you are looking for?
12|72|(They said: We have lost) we are looking for (the king's cup) in which he drinks and also uses formeasurement. This cup is made of gold and I am being accused of stealing it, (and he who bringeth it shallhave a camel load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it) I guarantee a camel load for him. All this wassaid by the youth whom Joseph had sent after his brothers.
12|73|(They said: By Allah, well ye know) O people of Egypt (we came not to do evil in the land) the land of Egyptby stealing or harming people, (and are no thieves) we have not taken what you are looking for.
12|74|(They said) Joseph's servant said: (And what shall be the penalty for it) what would be the penalty of thethief (if ye prove liars?)
12|75|(They said: The penalty for it!) the penalty against (He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty forit) is that he is to be taken as a slave. (Thus we requite wrong-doers) thus we punish the thieves in ourland.
12|76|(Then he) Joseph's servant (began the search with their bags before) searching (his brother's bag) where heobviously did not find it, (then he produced it from his brother's bag) from his brother Benjamin's bag. Theservant said to him: "May Allah lift your trouble as you have lifted mine". (Thus did We contrive) We did (forJoseph) We honoured him with knowledge, wisdom, prophethood and sovereignty. (He could not have takenhis brother according to the king's law unless Allah willed) and Allah willed that he does take his brotheraccording to the king's law because, according to the latter, the penalty for theft was beating and paymentof a fine; it was also said that according to the king's law, the penalty for theft was the amputation of limbsand payment of a fine; it is also said that (unless Allah willed) means: except those laws of the king whichJoseph knew to be pleasing to Allah, for he applied those. (We raise by grades (of mercy)) We raise thevirtues of (whom We will) as We do in the life of this world, (and over every lord of knowledge there is onemore knowing) above every one who knows there someone who knows more, and so on and so forth untilone stops at Allah, for there is no one who has more knowledge than Him.
12|77|(They said) the brothers of Joseph said: (If he stealeth) if Benjamin has stolen the king's cup, (a brother ofhis stole before) his full brother (Joseph) has stolen an idol before. (But Joseph kept it secret in his soul) hedid not answer this (and revealed it not unto them) his response. (He said) within himself: (Ye are in worsecase) your action is worse than that of Joseph (and Allah knoweth best (the Truth of) that which you allege)in relation to the matter of Joseph.
12|78|(They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath an aged father) who will be very happy to have him back, (sotake one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee) if you do so (of those who do kindness) for us.
12|79|(He said) Joseph said to them: (Allah forbid that we should seize) for the crime of theft (save him withwhom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers) by arresting someone with whom wedid not find our property.
12|80|(So, when they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them) the bestamong them in reasoning: Judah (said: Know ye not) my brothers (how your father took an undertakingfrom you in Allah's name) that you will bring him back (and how you failed) in your pledge and covenant (inthe case of Joseph aforetime) before this boy? (Therefore I shall not go forth from the land) of Egypt (untilmy father giveth leave) gives me leave to return; it is also said that this means: until my father gives mepermission to fight them (or Allah judgeth for me) the return of my brother. (He is the Best of Judges) inrelation to returning him to me.
12|81|Judah then said: (Return) O my brothers (unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen)the king's golden cup; it is also said that this means: your son was taken for stealing. (We testify only tothat which we know) we saw the stolen cup found in his bag; (we are not guardians of the Unseen) he said:if we knew the unseen, we would not have taken him; it is also said that this means: we could not look afterhim at night.
12|82|(Ask the township) the people of the township (where we were) it was one of the villages of Egypt, (and thecaravan) and the people of the caravan (with which we travelled hither) they had travelled with a group ofpeople from Canaan. (Lo! we speak the Truth) in that which we are saying to you. And so they told Jacobthese words.
12|83|((And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said) Jacob said to them: (Nay, butyour minds have beguiled you into something) your minds have enticed you to do something, and so you didit. ((My course is) comely patience!) what I have to do is to be patient and show no anxiety. (It may be thatAllah will bring them all) Joseph and his full brother as well as Judah (unto me. Lo! He, only He, is theKnower) of their whereabouts, (the Wise) in relation to returning them to me.
12|84|(And he turned away from them) he left them (and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes werewhitened with the sorrow) with tears (that he was suppressing) he kept his sorrow and grief within himself.
12|85|(They said) i.e. his children and his grandchildren: (By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph tillyour health is ruined or you art of those who perish) through death!
12|86|(He said) Jacob said: (I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that whichye know not) I know that Joseph's vision is true and that we will prostrate to him; it is also said that thismeans: I know of Allah's mercy and of His good work that which you do not; it is also said that this means: Iknow that Joseph is alive. That is because the angel of death came to him and he asked him: "did you takeaway the soul of Joseph from among those you took their souls away". And the angel said he did not.
12|87|For this reason, he said: (Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother) go and enquireabout Joseph and his brother Benjamin, (and despair not of the Spirit of Allah) despair not of the mercy ofAllah. (Lo! None despaireth of the Spirit of Allah) of the mercy of Allah (save disbelieving folk) save thepeople who disbelieve in Allah and His mercy.
12|88|(And when they came (again) before him (Joseph)) a third time (they said: O ruler! Misfortune) hunger(hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise) merchandise which is not suitable forbuying food, but are suitable for spending on people; it is also said that this means: merchandise that onecan get in the mountains such as pine nuts and the fruit of the terebinth-tree; it is also said that this means:Arab merchandise such as dried lumps of cheese, wool, cheese and ghee, (so fill for us the measure) give usour measure as you would give if we had good money (and be charitable unto us) in regards to difference inthe two prices; it is also said that this means: in regards to difference in the two measures. (Lo! Allah willrequite the charitable) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.
12|89|(He said) Joseph said to them: (Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance) whenyou were ignorant youth?
12|90|(They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother) my full brother.(Allah hath shown us favour) by bestowing patience upon us. (Lo! he who wardeth off (evil)) in times ofblessing (and endureth) in times of hardship finds favour; (for verily Allah loseth not) thwarts not (thewages) the reward (of the kindly) those who ward off evil and are patient.
12|91|(They said) Joseph's brothers said to Joseph: (By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred you above us, and wewere indeed sinful) towards you, and disobedient of Allah..
12|92|(He said) Joseph said to them: (Have no fear this day!) he says: I will not reproach you today. (May Allahforgive you) for what you did, (and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy) He is more Mercifulthan one's own parents.
12|93|(Go with this shirt of mine) and his shirt was from Paradise (and lay it on my father's face, he will become(again) a seer) he will regain his sight; (and come to me with all your folk) they were about seventy people.
12|94|(When the caravan departed) when the caravan left al-'Arish, a township between Egypt and Canaan, (theirfather) Jacob (had said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard) unless yousay I am foolish, discredit me or disbelieve in what I say.
12|95|((Those around him) said) those of his children who stayed with him and his grandchildren said: (By Allah,Lo! thou art in your old aberration) you are still in your old error concerning Joseph.
12|96|(Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came) i.e. Judah carrying the shirt, (he laid it on his face and hebecame a seer once more) he regained his sight. (He said) to his children and grandchildren: (Said I notunto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not?) did I not tell you that Joseph is still alive?
12|97|(They said) his children and grandchildren said: (O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us) ask Allahto forgive our sins, (for lo! we were sinful) we were wrong-doers and disobedient towards Allah.
12|98|(He said) to them: (I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord) I will pray to Allah for you on the night ofFriday, at the end of dawn. (He is the Forgiving, the Merciful) towards those who repent.
12|99|(And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him) he joined to him his father andstepmother, for his own mother was dead by then, (and said: Come into) dwell in (Egypt safe) from theenemies and from hunger, (if Allah will!) if Allah wills, you stay in Egypt safe from your enemies and hunger.
12|100|(And he placed his parents on the dais) on an elevated platform (and they fell down before him prostrate)i.e. his parents and brothers fell prostrate before him. This prostration was a sign of greeting between them:the person of humble standing prostrated to the person of high standing, the youth to the elderly and theyoung to the old; it is a slight bowing as is known among non-Arabs, (and he said: O my father! This)prostration (is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown mekindness, since He took me out of the prison) and saved me from slavery (and hath brought you from thedesert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren) through resentful envy. (Lo! my Lord istender unto whom He will) my Lord is tender in that He brought us together. (He is the Knower) of thatwhich has befallen us, (the Wise) in separating and then bringing us together.
12|101|(O my Lord! Thou hast given me (something) of sovereignty) you gave me the sovereignty of Egypt whichspreads over an area of forty parasangs by forty parasangs (and hast taught me (something) of theinterpretation of events) the interpretation of dreams, (Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art myProtecting Friend) You are Lord, Creator, Provider, Protector and Helper (in the world and the Hereafter.Make me to die submissive (unto Thee)) in my worship and confession of monotheism, (and join me to therighteous) join me in Paradise with the messengers among my forefathers.
12|102|(This) that which I mentioned to you, O Muhammad, of the story of Joseph and his brothers (is of thetidings of the Unseen) of the events which were hidden from you (which We inspire in thee (Muhammad))with which We send Gabriel to you. (Thou wast not present with them when they bed their plan) when theyagreed to throw Joseph in the well (and they were scheming) they were intending by this the peril ofJoseph.
12|103|(And though thou try much) no matter how hard you try, (most men) the people of Mecca (will not believe)in the scriptures and messengers.
12|104|(Thou askest them) O Muhammad (no fee) no payment (for it) for the profession of monotheism. (It is) i.e.the Qur'an (naught else than a reminder) an admonition (unto the peoples) unto the jinn and humans.
12|105|(How many a portent) a sign (is there in the heavens) such as the sun, the moon, the stars, etc., (and theearth) and that which is in the earth such as mountains, oceans, trees, beasts, etc., (which they) i.e. thepeople of Mecca (pass by with face averted!) they denied them and never reflected upon them.
12|106|(And most of them) the people of Mecca (believe not in Allah) deep in their hearts; it is also said that thismeans: they do not believe in the worship of Allah (except that they attribute partners (unto Him)) openly.
12|107|(Deem they) i.e. the people of Mecca (themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allah'spunishment) such as the punishment they were exposed to on the Day of Badr, (or the coming of the Hour)or that the punishment of the Hour seizes them (suddenly while they are unaware) of the descent ofpunishment?
12|108|(Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (This) the religion of Abraham (is my Way) my religion: (I callon Allah with sure knowledge) with a firm religion and exposition, (I) call on Allah (and whosoever followethme) they believe in me and also call on Allah with sure knowledge.

12|109|(We sent not before thee) O Muhammad, any messengers (save men whom We inspired) We send Gabrielto them as We sent him to you (from among the folk of the townships) they were related to townships likeyou. (Have they) the people of Mecca (not travelled in the land and seen) and reflect on (the nature of theconsequence for) how was the end result of (those who were before them) among the disbelievers? (Andverily the abode of the Hereafter) Paradise, (for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry andindecencies and instead believe in Allah, Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (is best.

12|110|(Till, when the messengers despaired) they despaired in the belief of their people (and thought) and knewand were certain, i.e. the messengers (that they) their people (were denied) the promise of the messengers;it is also said that this means: the people denied that which the messengers brought to them from Allah,(then came unto them Our help) i.e. Our chastisement, destroying their people, (and whom We would wassaved) i.e. the messengers and those who believed in them.

12|111|(In their history) in their events, the event of Joseph and his brothers (verily there is a lesson) a sign (formen of understanding) for people endowed with intelligence. (It is no invented story) the Qur'an is not aninvented story (but a confirmation of the existing (Scripture)) a confirmation of the Torah, the Gospel and allthe others scriptures; it confirms the profession of monotheism and other legal rulings as well as the story ofJoseph (and a detailed explanation of everything) a detailed explanation of the lawful and the unlawful, (anda guidance) from error (and a mercy) preventing from chastisement (for folk who believe) in Muhammad(pbuh) and in the Qur'an which was revealed to you from your Lord, and Allah knows the secrets of HisBook'.

13|27|(Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (say: If only a portent were sent down uponhim) why is Muhammad (pbuh) not given a sign (from his Lord!) to prove his prophethood, as was given toearlier messengers, as he claims.

13|28|(Who have believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (and whose hearts have rest) their hearts arecontent and quiescent (in the remembrance of Allah) in the Qur'an; it is also said that this means: inswearing by Allah.

13|31|Then the following was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi and his companions who said tothe Prophet: make the mountains disappear by means of your Qur'an; or make springs gush out of them,just as David did with the fount of copper, as you claim; or bring for us a wind by means of which we travelto Historic Syria and return, just as it was done by Solomon, according to you; or bring our dead to life asdid Jesus, as you claim. So Allah said: (Had it been possible for a Lecture) other than the Qur'an which hasbeen revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) (to cause the mountains to move) by means of which mountains aremade to disappear from the face of the earth, (or the earth to be torn asunder) by means of which to travellong distances, (or the dead to speak) or by means of which the dead are brought back to life, the Qur'anwhich was revealed to Muhammad (pbuh) would have done so.

(Is it that ye would inform Him) are yougoing to inform Him (of something which He knoweth not) to exist (in the earth) which benefits or harmsbeside Allah? (Or is it but a way of speaking) or is it just out of false talk, false testimony and lying that theydo worship them?

13|36|(Those unto whom We gave the Scripture) the Torah, the reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and hiscompanions (rejoice in that which is revealed unto thee) of the remembrance of the All-Merciful.

13|37|(Thus have We revealed it) thus have We sent Gabriel with the Qur'an, (a decisive utterance) the wholeQur'an is Allah's judgement (in Arabic) in the Arabic usage (and if thou shouldst follow their desires) theirreligion and Qiblah (after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge) after Abraham's Religion andQiblah were made clear to you, (then truly wouldst thou have from Allah) from Allah's torment (noprotecting friend) nearby to benefit you (nor defender) to save you from the torment.

(For everything there is a time prescribed) an appointed time.
13|39|(Allah effaceth what He will) from the scroll of the guardian angels which does not entail a reward orpunishment, (and establisheth (what He will)) and leaves that which entails a reward or punishment, (andwith Him is the source of ordinance) the source of the Book, i.e. the Preserved or Guarded Tablet, in whichnothing is added or taken away.

14|11|(Their messengers said unto them: We are but mortals) human beings (like you) we are but created beingslike you, (but Allah giveth grace unto whom He will of His slaves) by bestowing upon them prophethood andtotal surrender to Him. (It is not ours) it behoves us not (to bring you a warrant) a decree or proof (unlessby the permission of Allah) by the command of Allah. (In Allah let believers put their trust!) He says: thebelievers should rely on Allah.
14|12|They said to the messengers: "do yourselves put your trust in Allah so that you can see what He will do withyou". The messengers said: (How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways)when He favoured us with prophethood and complete surrender to Him? (We surely will endure that hurt yedo us) we will endure your physical harm through obedience of Allah. (In Allah let the trusting put theirtrust!) let them rely on Allah.
14|13|(And those who disbelieved said unto their messengers: Verily we will drive you out from our land) from ourtownship, (unless ye return to our religion. Then their Lord inspired them) i.e. the messengers, ((saying):)be steadfast! (Verily We shall destroy the wrong-doers) the disbelievers,
14|14|(And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land) in their township and habitations (after them) after theirdestruction. (This) dwelling in their land (is for him who feareth My Majesty) standing before Me [on the Dayof Judgement] (and feareth My threats) My chastisement.
14|15|(And they sought help) each people sought help against their prophet (and every froward) who turns awayfrom the Truth and guidance (potentate) deceitful, arrogant person (was brought to naught) they got nohelp when they requested it;
14|16|(Hell is before him) Hell is before this arrogant person when he dies, (and he is made to drink a festeringwater) and he is made to drink what comes of his skin of puss and blood.
14|17|(Which he sippeth) he sips puss and holds it in his throat (but can hardly swallow, and death) the agony ofdeath (cometh unto him from every side) from beneath every single hair that he has; it is also said that thismeans: the Fire surrounds him from every side (while yet he cannot die) from such a torment, (and beforehim) after sipping puss (is a harsh doom) harsher than drinking puss.
14|18|(A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their works) He says: the works of those who disbelievein their Lord (are as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day. They have no control of aughtthat they have earned) He says: they will not find the reward of their good works which were performed intheir state of disbelief, just as one will not find ashes when the wind blows hard on it. (That is the extremefailure) the error which is far remote from the Truth or guidance.
14|19|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad; Allah addressed His Prophet, but it is hispeople who are meant by this address: (that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth) toexplain the Truth and falsehood; it is also said that this means: He created them for evanescence andextinction? (If He will, He can remove you) He can destroy you, or make you die, O people of Mecca, (andbring (in) some new creation) and will create other beings who are better than you and more obedient toAllah.
14|20|(And that is no great matter for Allah) that is not very difficult for Allah; He says: it is not very difficult forAllah to destroy you and create different beings.
14|21|(They all) the leaders and the lowly among people (come forth unto their Lord) they emerge from thegraves by Allah's command. (Then those who were despised) the lowly among people (say unto those whowere scornful) towards faith, i.e. the leaders: (We were unto you a following) we obeyed your commands,(can ye then avert from us) bear on behalf of us (aught of Allah's doom? They say) i.e. the leaders: (HadAllah guided us) to His religion, (we should have guided you) we would have invited you to His religion.(Whether we rage) for being tormented (or patiently endure) or keep silent (is (now) all one for us: we haveno place of refuge) or helper.
14|22|(And Satan) Iblis (says, when the matter hath been decided) when the people of Paradise enter Paradiseand the people of hell enter hell; he says to the people of hell when they are in hell: (Lo! Allah promised youa promise of truth) He promised you that Paradise, hell, the Resurrection, the Reckoning, the Scale and theBridge over hell are all true; (and I promised you) that there is no Paradise, hell, the Resurrection, theReckoning, the Scale or the Bridge over hell, (then failed you) I lied to you. (And I had no power) proof,reason or power (over you save that I called unto you) to obey me (and ye obeyed me. So blame me not)for calling you, (but blame yourselves) for answering me. (I cannot help you) save you from thechastisement of hell, (nor can ye help me) nor can you save me from entering hell. (Lo! I disbelieved in thatwhich ye before) before you associated it with me; it is also said that this means: I disbelieve today in thatwhich you associate with me; he says: I disassociate myself from you and from your religion and from yourresponse to me before this, i.e. in the worldly life (ascribed to me) you associated with me. (Lo! For wrong-doers) for the disbelievers (is a painful doom) a severe torment that will extend to their hearts.
14|23|(And those who believed) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and did good works) acts of obediencesuch none knows them except Allah (are made to enter Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees andhabitations (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, therein abiding by permission of their Lord) by thecommand of their Lord, (their greeting) their favour (therein) in Paradise: (Peace!) when they meet therein,they greet one another.
14|24|(Seest thou you not) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, (how Allah coineth a similitude: A goodlysaying) He says: how Allah has exposited the description of a goodly saying which is "there is no god saveAllah", (as a goodly tree) which is the believer, (its root set firm) He says: the heart of the sincere believer isfirm by means of "there is no god save Allah", (its branches reaching into heaven) He says: due to it theworks of a sincere believer are accepted,
14|25|(Giving its fruit at every season) He says: the sincere believer performs goodness and acts of obedience toAllah at all times (by permission of its Lord?) He says: by command of its Lord; it is also said: the trait of agoodly saying insofar as its benefit and praise are concerned is like a goodly tree-the palm-tree-whose fruitsare goodly. And the same goes for the believer. He says: the origin of the tree is firmly grounded in the soilby means of its roots, and so is the believer: he is firm by means of proof and argument. (Its branchesreaching into heaven) He says: the branches of the palm-trees are raised towards the sky, and so are theworks of the believer raised to heaven. (Giving its fruit at every season) He says: it yields fruits every sixmonths by the will of its Lord, and so is the believer, he performs acts of goodness or obedience at all times.(Allah coineth the similitudes) thus Allah explains His divine Oneness by coining similes (for mankind in orderthat they may reflect) so that people may take heed and desire to profess His divine Oneness.
14|26|(And the similitude of a bad saying) associating partners with Allah (is as a bad tree) this refers to theidolater. He says: idolatry is blameworthy and no aspect of it is praiseworthy, just as the idolater is censoredand there is nothing praiseworthy about him; it is also said that the bad tree refers to the colocynth which isbitter and useless, and so is the idolater: useless and censored, (uprooted from upon the earth, possessingno stability) it has no firmness on the face of the earth; and so is the idolater: he does not have any proof tocling to, just as the colocynth does not have roots which keep it firmly grounded. Moreover, while a personis an idolater none of his works are accepted.
14|27|(Allah confirmeth those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an; it is also said that this means:those who believed were on the day of the Covenant with a good disposition of the soul, and these are thefelicitous people, (by a firm saying) the testification that there is no god but Allah (in the life of the world) sothat they do not go back on it (and in the Hereafter) i.e. in the grave when asked about it, (and Allahsendeth wrong-doers) the idolaters (astray) from the testification of there is no god but Allah in the life ofthis world, so that they do not say it with a good disposition of the soul, nor in the grave nor when theycome out of it. These are the people destined for damnation. (And Allah doeth what He will) whether it issending astray or holding people firm; it is also said: (And Allah doeth what He will) about turning awayMunkar and Nakir.
14|28|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, about (those who gave the grace of Allahin exchange) they changed the gift of Allah who bestowed upon them the Scripture and the messengers andinstead opted (for thanklessness) disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. These are the BanuUmayyah and the Banu'l-Mughirah who fed the army of the unbelievers on the Day of Badr, (and led theirpeople down to) they let the people of Mecca camp at (the Abode of Loss) the abode of destruction, i.e. theplace of Badr; it is also said that the Abode of Loss refers to Gehenna,
14|29|Allah then said: ((Even to) hell? They are exposed thereto) they will enter it on the Day of Judgement. (Ahapless end!) their abode and destination is Gehenna.
14|30|(And they set up rivals to Allah) they ascribed to Allah co-equals from among idols which they worshipped(that they may mislead (men) from His way) from His religion and obedience. (Say) O Muhammad, to thepeople of Mecca: (Enjoy life (while ye may)) in your state of disbelief (for lo! your journey's end will be theFire) on the Day of Judgement.
14|31|(Tell) O Muhammad (My bondmen who believe) in Me and in My Scripture and messengers (to establishworship) the five daily prayers, complete with their ritual ablution, bowings, prostrations and that which isobligated in them in their prescribed times (and spend of that which We have given them) and give alms,(secretly and publicly) these are the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (before a day comes) this is the Dayof Judgement (wherein there will be neither traffic) ransom (nor befriending) for the disbeliever, while thebeliever will benefit from his friendships.
14|32|Allah then declared His divine Oneness, saying: (Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth, andcauseth water) rain (to descend from the sky, thereby producing) the rain brought forth (fruits) differentkinds of fruit (as food for you) and for all other created beings, (and maketh the ships to be of service)subservient (unto you, that they) i.e. the ships (may run upon the sea at His command) by His permissionand will, (and hath made of service) subservient (unto you the rivers) they flow wherever you want;
14|33|(And maketh the sun and the moon, constant in their courses) until the Day of Judgement, (to be of serviceunto you) subservient to you, (and hath made of service) and made subservient (unto you the night and theday) which come and go.
14|34|(And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him) as well as that which you do not know even how to ask for, (and ifye would count the bounty of Allah) the blessings of Allah (ye cannot reckon it) you would not be able toremember them or give thanks for them. (Lo! Man) i.e. the disbeliever (is verily a wrong-doer) he associatesothers with Allah, (an ingrate) He disbelieves in Allah and in His blessings.
14|35|(And when Abraham said) after the building of the House: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Make safe) such that noturmoil takes place and whoever is in fear finds safety in (this territory) Mecca, (and preserve me and mysons from serving idols) from worshipping idols or fire.

(Lo! they have led many of mankind astray) i.e. they were made tolead many people astray; it is also said that this means: many people went astray because of them. (Butwhoso followeth me) whoever follows my religion and obeys me, (he verily is of me) he follows my religion.(And whoso disobeyeth me) whoever opposes my religion, (still Thou art Forgiving) of whoever repent ofamong them, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant.
14|37|(Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lo!

Thou knowest that which we hide) of the love of Ishmael (and that which weproclaim) of the love of Isaac; it is also said that this means: You know that which we hide of the love ofIshmael and what we proclaim of aloofness towards him. (Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hiddenfrom Allah) whether it is a good or evil work.
14|39|(Praise be to Allah) Thanks to Allah (Who hath given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac!) he was then100 years old and his wife Sarah was 99 years old. (Lo! my Lord is indeed the Hearer of Prayer) He answersprayers.

14|42|(Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do) do not think that Allah will not punish the idolatersfor what they do. (He but gives them a respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror)) the eyes of thedisbelievers will stare in terror on the Day of Judgement.
14|43|(As they come hurrying on in fear) looking to the caller, (their heads upraised) stretching their necks; it isalso said that this means: lowering down their heads, (their gaze returning not to them) out of fear andterror, (and their hearts as air) empty from all goodness; it is also said: neither coming out nor going backin.
14|44|(And warn mankind) warn the people of Mecca by means of the Qur'an (of a day) the Day of Badr; it is alsosaid that this is a reference to the Day of Judgement (when the doom will come upon them, and those whodid wrong) the idolaters (will say: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Reprieve us for a little while) in the life of thisworld. (We will obey Your call) to monotheism (and will follow the messengers) we will obey themessengers. Allah will then say to them: (Did ye not swear before) before this, when you were in the life ofthe lower world (that there would be no end for you) in the life of the world and that there is noresurrection?

15|2|(It may be that those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (wish ardently that they wereMuslims) in this worldly life. He says: there may come a day when the disbeliever would wish that he was aMuslim.

15|57|(He said) Abraham said to Gabriel and his aids: (And afterward what is your business) what is the matter,why did you come, O you messengers (of Allah)?)
15|58|(They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk) to idolaters who brought destruction upon themselvesbecause of their evil acts, meaning here the people of Lot.

15|60|(Except his wife) his other wife, Wa'ilah the hypocrite, (of whom We had decreed that she should be ofthose who stay behind) and be destroyed.
15|61|(And when the messengers) Gabriel and his helpers (came unto the family of Lot) to Lot,

15|65|(So travel with thy household in a portion of the night) at the end of the night, at dawn, (and follow youtheir backs) walk behind them in the direction of Sa'ar . (Let none of you turn round) let none of you lagbehind, (but go whither ye are commanded) towards Sa'ar.
15|66|(And We made plain the case to him) We commanded him to go to Sa'ar, (that the root of them (who didwrong)) the people of Lot (was to be cut at early morn) in the morning.
15|67|(And the people of the city came) to the house of Lot, (rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals)) and at theprospect of engaging in their evil acts.
15|68|(He said) Lot said to them: (Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not!) do not shame me in front of them.

15|73|(Then the (Awful) Cry) of chastisement (overtook them at the sunrise) when the sun was rising.
15|74|(And We utterly confounded them) We turned their location upside down, (and We rained upon them) upontheir sodomites and sinners (stones of heated clay) coming down from the first heaven; it is also said thatthese stones were of manure and mud which were heated up like bricks.

15|78|(And the dwellers in the wood) i.e. the people of Shu'ayb (indeed were evil-doers) idolaters.

15|80|(And the dwellers in Al-Hijr) the people of Salih (indeed denied (Our) messengers) Salih and all the othermessengers.

15|89|(And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner) I am a messenger warning you against Allah's chastisement, in alanguage that you all understand,

15|92|(Them, by thy Lord) O Muhammad; Allah here swore by Himself, (We shall question) on the Day ofJudgement, (every one),

He drankso much water that his stomach burst open and he died, may Allah ruin him. And among them was al-AswadIbn 'Abd al-Muttalib whose head Gabriel banged on a tree and then hit his face with thorns until he died,may Allah curse him. And among them is al-Aswad Ibn 'Abd Yaghuth who left his house in an extremely hotday and was caught by the simoom such that his colour turned black and resembled an Abyssinian.

As a response, Allah revealed: (The commandment of Allah willcome to pass) the chastisement of Allah has come. The Prophet (pbuh) was sitting at that point and hesuddenly stood, having no doubt in his mind that the chastisement had come. But immediately after that,Allah said: (so seek not ye to hasten it) i.e. the chastisement, at which the Prophet (pbuh) sat down.(Glorified) Allah exonerated Himself from having a son or partner (and Exalted be He) He is too elevated andabsolves Himself (above all that they associate (with Him)) of idols.

(Ah! evil is that which theybear!) evil are the sins which they bear, i.e. those who were slain at the valley of Badr among the leaders ofQuraysh.
16|26|(Those before them plotted) against their prophets, just as the leaders of Quraysh who were slain in thevalley of Badr plotted against Muhammad (pbuh); the reference here is to the tyrant Nimrod who built thetower, (so Allah struck at the foundations of their building) Allah extracted their tower from its foundation,(and then the roof fell down upon them) the tower fell upon him (from above them, and the doom came onthem) through this destruction (whence they knew not);

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord be glorified!) I exonerate my Lord fromhaving a son or partner, (Am I naught save a mortal messenger?) he says: I am only a human messenger,like all previous messengers.
17|94|(And naught prevented mankind) the people of Mecca (from believing) in Allah (when the guidance)Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (came unto them save that they said) these words: (Hath Allah sent amortal as (His) messenger) to us?
17|95|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sentdown for them from heaven an angel as messenger) for we send angel messengers only to angels andhuman messengers to humans.
17|96|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Allah sufficeth for a witness between me and you) that I am amessenger to you (Lo! He is) in relation to sending messengers to His servants (Knower, Seer of His slaves)those who believe and those who do not.
17|97|(And he whom Allah guideth) to His religion, (he is led aright) to His religion; (while, as for him whom Hesendeth astray) from His religion, (for them) for the people of Mecca (thou wilt find no protecting friendsbeside Him) to lead them to guidance, (and We shall assemble them) We shall drag them (on the Day ofResurrection on their faces) to the Fire, (blind) seeing nothing, (dumb) saying nothing (and deaf) hearingnothing; (their habitation) their destination (will be hell; whenever it abateth) whenever the Fire abates andits flames subside, (We increase the flame for them) We add more fuel to it.
17|98|(That) chastisement (is their reward) their lot (because they disbelieved Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh)and the Qur'an (and said) and the disbelievers of Mecca said: (When we are) rotten (bones and) scattered(fragments shall we, forsooth, be raised up) revived (as a new creation?) the spirit is renewed in us? Thiscan never happen!
17|99|(Have they) i.e. the people of Mecca (not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able tocreate) to revive (the like of them, and has appointed for them an end) a term (whereof there is no doubt)as far as the believers are concerned? (But the wrong-doers) the idolaters (refuse aught save disbelief) theyrejected this and stayed firm in their disbelief.
17|100|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (If you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord) ifyou possessed the keys to the stores of the provision of my Lord, (ye would surely hold them back for fearof spending) for fear of becoming poor, (for man) i.e. the disbelieving man (was ever grudging)parsimonious, stingy and tight-fisted.
17|101|(And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) nine clear signs: the hand,the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, blood, the years of drought and the disappearance of properties.(Do but ask the Children of Israel) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (how he) Moses (came unto them,then Pharaoh said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses) I think that you are possessed.
17|102|(He said) Moses said to him: (In truth thou knowest) O Pharaoh (that none sent down these (portents))these signs (save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs) as an indication and sign of myprophethood, (and lo!

17|103|(And he wished to scare them from the land) the land of Jordan and Palestine, (but We drowned him) in thesea (and those with him, all together).
17|104|(And We said unto the Children of Israel after him) after his destruction: (Dwell in the land) the land ofJordan and Palestine; (but when the promise of the Hereafter) when resurrection after death; and it is alsosaid that this means: when Jesus son of Mary descends (cometh to pass we shall bring you as a crowdgathered out of various nations.)
17|105|(With truth have We sent it down) We have sent Gabriel to Muhammad (pbuh) with the Qur'an, (and withtruth hath it descended) he descended with the Qur'an. (And We have sent thee) O Muhammad (as naughtelse save a bearer of good tidings) of Paradise (and a warner) from hell.
17|106|(And (it is) a Qur'an) And We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an (that We have divided) We explained thereinthe lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions, (that thou mayst recite it unto mankind atintervals) in a composed manner, deliberately and thoughtfully, (and We have revealed it by (successive)revelation) We have exposited it clearly; it is also said that this means: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'anin different phases, each time with two or three verses, and so on and so forth.
17|107|(Say) O Muhammad, to them: (Believe therein) believe in the Qur'an (or believe not) this is a threat to them,(lo! those who were given knowledge) those who were given knowledge of the Torah and are aware of thedescription and attributes of Muhammad (pbuh) (before it) before the Qur'an, (when it is read unto them)when the Qur'an is read to them, (fall down prostrate on their faces, adoring) they prostrate to Allah,
17|108|(Saying: Glory to our Lord!) they exonerate Allah from having a son or partner. (Verily the promise of ourLord) regarding the sending of Muhammad (pbuh) (must be fulfilled) is true and must happen.
17|109|(They fall down on their faces) in prostration, (weeping) in their prostration, (and it increaseth humility inthem) this was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions.
17|110|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto whichsoever ye cry (it is thesame). His are the most beautiful names) the most sublime attributes such as knowledge, power, hearing,sight; so call Him by using them. (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud voiced in thy worship) do not be tooloud in your recitation of the Qur'an during prayer so that the idolaters do not harm you (nor yet silenttherein) such that your Companions cannot hear you, (but follow a way between) a middle ground betweenloud and silent recitation.
17|111|(And say: Praise be to Allah) gratitude and divinity are Allah's, (Who hath not taken unto Himself a son)from amongst the angels or humans such that he inherits His dominion, (and Who hath no partner in theSovereignty) such that he shows enmity towards Him, (nor hath He any protecting friend) a helper (throughdependence) from among the Jews and Christians; it is also said that this means: He has not beenhumiliated such that He needs a helper from the Jews or Christians. (And magnify Him with allmagnificence) deem Him far exalted above what the Jews, Christians and idolaters say about Him; and Allahknows better the secrets of His Book.
18|1|And from his own narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the meaning of Allah'swords (Praise be to Allah): '(Praise be to Allah) He says: gratitude is Allah's and divinity is His (Who hathrevealed the Scripture) who has sent Gabriel with the Qur'an (unto His slave) Muhammad (pbuh) (and hathnot placed therein any crookedness) He did not reveal it as different from the Torah, the Gospel or otherScriptures, as far as divine Oneness and the attributes and description of Muhammad (pbuh) are concerned.This verse was revealed about the Jews when they claimed that the Qur'an was different from all previousScriptures,
18|2|((But hath made it) straight) and it is also said that this means: custodian over all other Scriptures, (to givewarning) so that Muhammad (pbuh) gives warning by means of the Qur'an (of stern punishment from Him,and to bring) and so that Muhammad brings the Qur'an (unto the) sincere (believers who do good works)between them and their Lord (the news that theirs will be a fair reward) they will have a fair reward inParadise.
18|3|(Wherein they will abide for ever) they will abide in this reward forever: never to die or be removed from it;
18|4|(And to warn) and so that Muhammad (pbuh) warns by means of the Qur'an (those who say: Allah hathchosen a son) i.e. the Jews, Christians and idolaters,
18|5|((A thing) whereof they have no knowledge) they have no proof or argument for what they claim, (nor (had)their fathers) nor did their fathers have any knowledge. (Dreadful is the word) dreadful is the word ofidolatry (that cometh out of their mouths) that is uttered by their mouth. (They speak naught but a lie)about Allah.
18|6|(Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement) if they do not believe in this Qur'an, (that thou) OMuhammad (wilt torment thy soul) kill yourself (with grief over their footsteps) for them.
18|7|(Lo! We have placed all that is in the earth) of male and female (as an ornament thereof) as anembellishment for the earth (that we may try them) that We may test them: (which of them is best inconduct) which of them is more sincere in works. It is also said that this means: We have made all thatwhich is on earth of plants, trees, beasts, and comfort an ornament for the earth so that We test themwhich of them is more unattached to, and shunning of, this world.
18|8|(And lo! We shall make) change (all that is therein) of ornament into (a barren mound) a smooth dust withno vegetation.
18|9|(Or deemest thou) O Muhammad (that the People of the Cave and the Inscription) whereof the names ofthese youth and their story were inscribed; it is also said that the inscription refers to the valley where thiscave was; and it is also said that it refers to a city (are a wonder among Our portents) such as the sun, themoon, the sky, the earth, the stars, the oceans and even that which is more wonderous than this?
18|10|(When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave) when a group of youth entered the Cave (and said) whenthey entered the cave: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Give us mercy from Thy presence) i.e. make us hold firmlyto your religion (and shape for us right conduct in our plight) make for us a way out.
18|11|(Then We sealed up their hearing) We cast sleep over them, such that they slept (in the Cave for a numberof years) 309 years.
18|12|(And afterward We raised them up) We woke them up just as We sent them to sleep (that We might know)We might see (which of the two parties) the believers or the disbelievers (would best calculate the time) theduration (that they had tarried) in the Cave.
18|13|(We narrate unto thee) We exposit to you (their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who believed intheir Lord, and We increased them in guidance) in insight into the matter of their religion; it is also said thatthis means: We made them firm in their faith.
18|14|(And We made firm their hearts) We preserved their hearts with faith; it is also said that: We inspired themto hold fast to patience (when they stood forth) when they left the disbelieving emperor Decius (Duqyanus)(and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto) we worship (no god beside Him,for then should we utter an enormity) for then we would be telling lies and falsehood about Allah.
18|15|(These, our people, have chosen (other) gods) they have worshipped idols (beside Him though they bringno clear warrant) a clear proof ((vouchsafed) to them) that Allah commanded them to worship them. (Andwho doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah) that He has a partner?
18|16|(And when ye withdraw from them) and when you leave them and their religion (and that which theyworship) of idols beside Allah, therefore worship none (except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave) enter thisCave; (your Lord will spread for you) He will bestow upon you (of His mercy) of His blessings (and willprepare for you a pillow in your plight) He will prepare for you that which will be kind towards youtomorrow. All this was said by the group of youth.
18|17|(And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away) decline (from their cave to the right) theright of the Cave, (and when it set go past them on the left) the left of the Cave, (and they were in the cleftthereof) on a side of the Cave; it is also said that this means: they were in a space which was reached bythe light of day. (That) which I have mentioned of their story (was (one) of the portents of Allah) of themarvels of Allah. (He whom Allah guideth) to His religion, (he indeed is led aright) to his religion, (and hewhom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend) who might lead him to the guidance.
18|18|(And thou wouldst have deemed them) O Muhammad (waking) not sleeping (though they were asleep, andwe caused them to turn over to the right and the left) once each year so that the earth does not eat awaytheir flesh, (and their dog) Qatmir (stretching out his paws on the threshold) at the entrance of the Cave. (Ifthou hadst observed them closely) in that state (thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, andhadst been filled with awe of them) and you would have been sacred of them.
18|19|(And in like manner We awakened them), after 309 years, (that they might question one another) so thatthey might talk to one another. (A speaker from among them) this is their chief and leader: Maxmillian(Maksilmina) (said : How long have ye tarried) in this Cave after you slept? (They said: We have tarried aday) and when they left the cave and saw that the sun did set yet, they said: (or some part of a day.(Others) said) i.e. Maxmillian: (Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried) after you slept. (Now send oneof you) Yamblichus (Yamlikha) (with this your silver coin unto the city) of Ephesus (Afsus), (and let him seewhat food is purest there) the largest quantity; it is also said that this means: the best of bread and mostlawful slaughtered meat (and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous) when buying (and let noman) let no Magian (know of you) find out about you.
18|20|(For they, if they) the Magians (should come to know of you, will stone you) kill you (or turn you back totheir religion) Zoroastrianism; (then ye will never prosper) you will never escape from Allah's punishment.
18|21|(And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city)) the city of Ephesus, the believers amongthem and the disbelievers, and their king of the time was a believer called Yustafad, the king Decius haddied long before that (that they might know) both the believers and disbelievers (that the promise of Allah)resurrection after death (is true) takes place, (and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it.When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves) when their words differed amongthemselves, (they said) i.e. the disbelievers said: (Build over them a building) a church because they arefollowers of our religion; (their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said) thosewhose argument did not prevail, i.e. the believers: (We verily shall build a place of worship over them)because they are followers of our religion; their difference being about this point.
18|22|((Some) will say) the Christians of Najran, al-Sayyid and his followers who were Nestorians, will say: (Theywere three) they were three young men in the Cave, (their dog) Qatmir (the fourth, and (some) say) al-'Aqib and his followers who were Jacobite Christians will say: (Five) they were five young men, (their dogthe sixth, guessing at random) without having definite knowledge; (and (some) say) the followers of al-Malikwho were Melkites: (Seven) they were seven young men, (and their dog the eighth. Say) to them, OMuhammad: (My Lord is best aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few) among the believers.Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, said: "I am among those few: they wereeight young men, and the dog". (So contend not concerning them) so do not argue with them concerningthe number of the sleepers of the Cave (except with an outward contending) unless you recite the Qur'an tothem outwardly, (and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them) do not ask any one of themabout their number; enough is what Allah has clarified to you.
18|23|(And say not) O Muhammad (of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow) or I shall say that tomorrow,
18|24|(Except if Allah will) unless you second it by saying: if Allah will. (And remember thy Lord) without exception(when thou forgettest) even if it is after a while, (and say: It may be that my Lord guideth me) and lead me(unto a nearer way of truth than this) a more correct and certain way than this. This verse was revealedabout the Prophet (pbuh) for he said to the idolaters of Mecca when they asked him about the spirit:"tomorrow, I will answer you", and he forgot to say "if Allah wills".
18|25|(And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine) before Allah made them wakeup.
18|26|(Say) O Muhammad: (Allah is best aware how long they tarried) after that. (His is the Invisible of theheavens and the earth) His is that which is hidden from the servants. (How clear of sight is He and keen ofhearing!) so hear and know what I see and know about them and their matter (They have no protectingfriend beside Him) they have no one to protect them beside Allah; it is also said that this means: the peopleof Mecca have no close one to benefit them against Allah's chastisement, (and He maketh none to share inHis government) in His dominion of the Unseen.
18|27|(And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord) He says: recite to them theQur'an, neither increasing nor decreasing anything from it. (There is none who can change His words, andthou wilt find no refuge beside Him) beside Allah.
18|28|(Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord) who worship their Lord (at morn and evening)the reference here is to Salman al-Farisi and his fellow believers, (seeking His Countenance) by worshippingHim they seek only Allah's Countenance and good pleasure; (and let not your eyes overlook them, desiringthe pomp of the life of the world) the embellishment of this worldly life; (and obey not him whose heart Wehave made heedless of Our remembrance) of Our divine Oneness, (who followeth his own lust) byworshipping the idols (and whose case) and whose words (hath been abandoned) at a loss. This verse wasrevealed about 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari.
18|29|(Say) to 'Uyaynah: ((It is) the Truth) there is no deity except Allah (from the Lord of you (all). Thenwhosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve) this is a threat from Allah; it is alsosaid that this means: for whomever Allah wants faith, he will believe; and for whomever He does not wantfaith, he will not believe. (Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers) for 'Uyaynah and his host (Fire. Its tentencloseth them) the extent of the Fire surrounds them. (If they ask for showers) if they ask for water todrink, (they will be showered with water like molten lead) like boiling oil or hot liquid silver (which burneththe faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting place!) evil is their dwelling; He says: evil is the abode oftheir companions: the satans and the disbelievers.
18|30|(Lo! as for those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) between themand their Lord, (Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost) We thwart not thereward of him whose works are sincere.
18|31|(As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden) the compartment of the All-Merciful, (wherein rivers) rivers ofwine, water, honey and milk (flow beneath them) i.e. beneath their trees and habitations; (therein) inParadise (they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery,reclining upon) sitting in Paradise on (thrones therein) on canopies. (Blest the reward) in Paradise, (and fairthe resting place!) He says: fair is the abode: the abode of their companions: the prophets and righteous.
18|32|(Coin for them a similitude) explain to the people of Mecca, the description of: (Two men) two brothers fromthe Children of Israel, one of whom is a believer, Yehuda, and the other a disbeliever, Abufatrus, (unto oneof whom) the disbeliever (We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put between them) between the gardens (tillage) a plantation.
18|33|(Each of the gardens gave its fruit) every year (and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gushforth therein) in their middle.
18|34|(And he had fruit) the garden had fruits; or according to a different reading: wealth. (And he said unto hiscomrade) the believer: Yehuda, (when he spake with him) bragging to him about his wealth: (I am morethan thee in wealth, and stronger about men) I have more servants.
18|35|(And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself) through his disbelief. (He said: I think notthat all this will ever perish).
18|36|(I think not that the Hour will ever come) will ever take place, (and if indeed I am brought back unto myLord) as you claim (I surely shall find better than this) garden (as a resort) as a returning place.
18|37|(And his comrade) the believer, (while he disputed with him) such that he may renounce his disbelief,(exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust) He created you from Adam and Adam isfrom dust, (then of a drop (of seed)) of your father, (and then fashioned you a man) of an upright stature?
18|38|(But) I say (He is Allah, my Lord) my Creator and Provider, (and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner) amongidols.
18|39|(If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah willeth (will come to pass)!) thisis from Allah and not from me. (There is no strength save in Allah!) this is only through Allah's power, notthrough my own power. (Though thou seest me as less than you in wealth and children) and servants in thelife of this world.
18|40|(Yet it may be) 'may be' when used in connection to Allah denotes a requisite (that my Lord will give me) inthe Hereafter (better than your garden) in the life of this world, (and will send on it) on your garden (a bolt)of fire (from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside) smooth dust,
18|41|(Or some morning the water thereof) the water of the garden (will be lost in the earth) will sink in the earth,out of reach (so that thou canst not make search for it) so that you cannot access it.
18|42|(And his fruit was beset (with destruction)) his garden was destroyed; or, according to another reading: hiswealth was destroyed. (Then began he to wring his hands) out of regret (for all that he had spent upon it)upon the garden; it is also said that this means: upon all the fruits it contained, (when (now) it was allruined on its trellises, and to say) on the Day of Judgement: (Would that I had ascribed no partner to myLord!) would that I had ascribed no idols to my Lord!
18|43|(And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah) i.e. against Allah's punishment, (nor could hesave himself) from Allah's punishment.
18|44|(In this case is protection only from Allah) i.e. on the Day of Judgement, dominion and sovereignty belongonly to Allah, (the True) the Just. (He is best for reward) He is the best of those who reward, (and best forconsequence) and the One who gives the best outcome.
18|45|(And coin for them) explain to the people of Mecca (the similitude of the life of the world) in its permanenceand evanescence (as water) as rain (which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earthmingleth with it) the water mixes with the vegetation of the earth (and then becometh dry twigs that thewinds scatter) such that nothing remains of it. Likewise, the life of this world will vanish and nothing of itsadornment will remain. (Allah is Able to do all things) He is Able to make the life of this world vanish and theHereafter subsist.
18|46|Allah then mentions the comfort that the life of this world contains, saying: (Wealth and children are anornament of life of the world) but they do not last just as dry twigs do not. (But the good deeds whichendure) the five daily prayers; it is also said that the reference here is to: that which is lasting in reward.Good deeds include the saying of: "Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no deity save Allah andAllah is the greatest", (are better in thy Lord's sight for reward) for recompense, (and better about hope) theprayer is the best work by means of which the servants can be helpful.
18|47|(And (bethink you of) the Day when We remove the hills) from the face of the earth (and ye see the earthemerging) from beneath mountains, (and We gather them) for the Resurrection (together so as to leave notone of them behind).

(But youthought) you said in the life of the world (that We had set no tryst for you) that We had set no appointedterm for the Resurrection.
18|49|(And the Book is placed) on people's right and left hands; the scrolls fell on people's hands like snow flakes,(and thou seest the guilty) the idolaters and the hypocrites (fearful of that which is therein) in the Book,(and they say: What Kind of a book is this that leaveth not a small thing) of our deeds (nor a great thing) itis said that the small thing is a smile and the great thing is laughter (but has counted it) except that it ispreserved and written down! (And they find all that they did) of good or evil (confronting them) writtendown, (and thy Lord wrongeth no one) He does not decrease the good deeds of anyone nor increase the evildeeds of anyone; it is also said that this means: He does not diminish the good deeds of the believer norleave the evil deeds of the unbeliever.
18|50|(And (remember) when We said unto the angels) who were on the earth: (Fall prostrate before Adam) aprostration of greeting, (and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis) their leader.

(Will ye choose him) will you worship him (and his seed for your protecting friends) as lords (insteadof Me) instead of Allah, (when they are an enemy unto you) whose enmity is quite manifest? (Calamitous isthe exchange) in worship; it is also said that this means: evil is that which they exchanged: they exchangedthe worship of Allah with the worship of Satan; and it is also said: they exchanged the protecting friendshipof Allah with the protecting friendship of Satan (for evil-doers) for idolaters!
18|51|(I made them not) i.e. the angels and the satans (to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth)when I created them, (nor their own creation) when I created them; it is also said that this means: I did notseek the help of angels and satans to create the heavens and the earth or to create them; (nor choose Imisleaders) the disbelievers, the Jews, Christians and idol worshippers (for (My) helpers).

18|59|(And (all) those townships!) And all the people of the townships of old (We destroyed them when they didwrong) when they disbelieved, (and We appointed a fixed time for their destruction).
18|60|Allah then mentioned the story of Moses with Khidr. It so happened that it came to Moses's mind that thereis no servant on the face of the earth who is more knowledgeable than him. And so Allah said to Moses: "Ihave a servant on earth who is more obedient to Me and more knowledgeable than you, and this servant isKhidr". Moses said: "O Lord! Guide me to him". He said: "Take with you salted fish and walk along the seashores until you find a rock in which there is the fountain of life. Sprinkle some of the water on the fish untilit comes back to life. There you will meet Khidr". Allah said: (And when Moses said unto his servant) hisservant was Shajardah Joshua ben Nun, an Israelite nobleman. He was his servant in the sense that he kepthis company and served him: (I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet) where seawater meets with river water, i.e. where the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea meet, (though I marchon for ages) or I will continue going on for years.
18|61|(And when they reached the point where the two met) between the two seas, (they forgot their fish) theyforgot the matter of their fish, (and it took its way into the waters, being free).
18|62|(And when they had gone further) from the rock, (he said unto his servant) Shajardah: (Bring us ourbreakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey).
18|63|(He said) Joshua said: (Didst thou see) O Moses, (when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the fish)the matter of the fish (and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it) to you, (it took its way intothe waters by a marvel) it was dry land.
18|64|(He said) Moses said: (This is that which we have been seeking) as an indication from Allah to Khidr (theyretraced their steps again) they went back, following their own footsteps.
18|65|(Then found they) at the rock (one of Our slaves) i.e. Khidr, (unto whom We had given mercy from Us) Hesays: We favoured him with prophethood, (and had taught him knowledge from Our presence) theknowledge of future events.
18|66|(Moses said unto him: May I follow thee) may I keep your company, (to the end that thou mayst teach meright conduct of that which thou hast been taught) that you may teach me guidance and that which is right?
18|67|(He said) O Moses: (Lo! thou canst not bear with me) for you may see me doing something that you will notbe able to bear.
18|68|When Moses said he will be able to bear anything, Khidr said: (How canst thou) O Moses (bear with thatwhereof thou canst not compass any knowledge) that the explanation of which you have not been given?
18|69|(He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me) O Khidr (patient) in relation to that which I see from you (and Ishall not in aught gainsay thee) I will not disobey your command.
18|70|(He said) Khidr said: (Well, if thou go with me) if you keep my company, O Moses, (ask me not concerningaught) about what I do (till I myself mention of it unto you) until I proceed to explain it to you.
18|71|(So the twain set out) so both Khidr and Moses (pbut) set out (till, when they were in the ship) to crossover, (he made a hole therein) Khidr made a hole in the ship. ((Moses) said) to him: (Hast thou made a holetherein to drown the folk thereof? Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing) towards the people of the ship.
18|72|(He said) Khidr said to him: (Did I not tell thee) O Moses (thou couldst not bear with me?)
18|73|((Moses) said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot) your advice, (and be not hard upon me for my fault) donot tax me severely for my fault.
18|74|(So the twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad) between two townships, (he slew him) Khidr killedhim. ((Moses) said: What! Hast thou) O Khidr (slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man? Verily thouhast done a horrid thing) you have committed a horrendous, evil act.
18|75|(He said) Khidr said: (Did I not tell thee) O Moses (that thou couldst not bear with me? Did I not tell youthat you might see me doing something that you will not be able to tolerate?
18|76|((Moses) said: If I ask thee) O Khidr (after this) after killing this soul (concerning aught, keep not companywith me. Thou hast received an excuse from me) you have an excuse to part company with me.
18|77|(So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain township) Antioch, (they askedits folk for food) they asked its inhabitants for bread, (but they refused to make them guests) they refusedto give them food. (And they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he repaired it)Khidr repaired it. ((Moses) said: If thou hadst wished) O Khidr, (thou couldst have taken payment for it) inthe form of bread that we could eat.
18|78|(He said) Khidr said: (This is the parting between thee and me) O Moses! (I will announce unto thee theinterpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience).
18|79|(As for the ship) in which I made a hole, (it belonged to poor people working on the river) transportingpeople across the river, (and I wished to mar it) I wished to damage it, (for there was a king) called Jalandi(behind them) ahead of them (who is taking every ship by force) and this is why I damaged it.
18|80|(And as for the lad) whom I killed, (his parents were believers) and of the greatest people of that township(and We feared lest he should oppress them) and your Lord Knew that he will overburden them (by rebellionand disbelief) by means of his rebellion and disobedience, and by lying in oath and so He killed him.
18|81|(And We intended that their Lord should change him for them for one) another child (better in purity)righteous (and nearer to mercy) who is more keen to keep ties of kinship. Allah gave them instead of him agirl who later married a prophet and from whom she gave birth to a prophet at whose hand a great numberof people were guided. The son killed by Khidr, whose name was Jaysur, was, on the other hand, adisbeliever, a thief and a murderer. This is why Khidr killed him.
18|82|(And as for the wall) which I repaired, (it belonged to two orphan boys) called Asram and Suraym (in thecity) of Antioch, (and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them) it was a tablet of gold containingknowledge and wisdom and written on it: "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. I am reallyamazed regarding a person who believes in death: how could he ever be happy; and amazed at a personwho believes in the evanescence of this worldly life and the fluctuation of its people: how he can findtranquillity in it; there is no deity except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)" (and theirfather had been righteous) he was a trustworthy man called Kashih, (and your Lord intended that theyshould come to their full strength) that they should reach the age of puberty (and should bring forth theirtreasure) i.e. their golden tablet (as a mercy from their Lord) as a blessing from your Lord; it is also saidthat this means: as an inspiration from your Lord; (and I did it not upon my own command) I did not do itfrom my own initiative. (Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear).
18|83|(They) the people of Mecca (will ask thee) O Muhammad (of Dhu'l-Qarnayn) about the event of Dhu'l-Qarnayn. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him) I shall recite to youan explanation of his event.
18|84|(Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave unto every thing a road) the knowledge of the roads andconstellation.
18|85|(And he followed a road) he set out on a road,
18|86|(Till, when he reached the setting place of the sun) where the sun sets, (he found it setting in a muddyspring) a blackened, muddy and stinking spring; it is also said that this means: a hot spring, (and found apeople thereabout) these people were disbelievers: (We said: O Dhu'l-Qarnayn!) We inspired him (Eitherpunish) either kill them until they accept to believe that there is no deity except Allah (or show themkindness) or you pardon them and let them be.
18|87|(He said: As for him who doth wrong) as for him who disbelieves in Allah, (we shall punish him) in thisworldly life by killing him, (and then he will be brought back unto his Lord) in the Hereafter, (who will punishhim) by means of the Fire (with awful punishment!) with a severe punishment.
18|88|(But as for him who believeth) in Allah (and doeth right) sincerely to Allah, (good will be his reward)Paradise will be his reward in the Hereafter, (and We shall speak unto him a mild command) we shall speakto him in a kind manner.
18|89|(Then he followed a road) toward the East.
18|90|(Till, when he reached the rising place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had appointedno helper therefrom) these people had no shelter to protect them from the sun, they had no mountains,trees or clothes. They were naked creatures who were blind to the Truth.
18|91|(So (it was)) just as he reached the West, so did he reach the East. (And We knew all concerning him) Weknew what he had of information and exposition.
18|92|(Then he followed a road) he set out towards the East, to Byzantium.
18|93|(Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither side) between the twomountains (a folk that scarce could understand a saying) from other people.
18|94|(They said) to the interpreter: (O Dhu'l-Qarnayn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land) they aredestroying our land, they eat our dates, loot our crops and kill our offspring; it is also said that this means:they devour people, for Gog and Magog were two men from the descendent of the children of Yapheth; it isalso said that they were called Gog and Magog due to their sheer number. (So may we pay thee tribute) areward; and it is also said that this means a wage, according to a different reading, (on condition that thouset a barrier between us and them?)
18|95|(He said: That wherein my Lord hath established me) the dominion that my Lord has given me is (better)than your reward or wage. (Do but help me with strength) they said: "which strength do you want from us"and he said: "the strength of blacksmiths", (I will set between you and them a bank) a barrier.
18|96|(Give me pieces of iron till, when he had levelled up (the gap) between the cliffs, he said: Blow!) and sothey blew into the Fire (till, when he had made it a fire) He says: when the iron became as hot as the Fireand thus melted, (he said: Bring me molten copper to pour thereon) to pour on the wall.
18|97|(And (Gog and Magog) were not able to surmount) to climb over it, (nor could they pierce (it)) frombeneath.
18|98|(He said: This) wall (is a mercy from my Lord) to you; (but when the promise of my Lord cometh to pass)and Gog and Magog break free, (He will lay it low) He will break it, (for the promise of my Lord) that theywill break free (is true) and this will surely take place.
18|99|(And on that day) the day when Gog and Magog break free; and it is also said: the day of return fromByzantium in that they were not able to defeat it, (We shall let some of them surge against others, and theTrumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering).
18|100|(On that day) the Day of Judgement (We shall present hell) We shall reveal hell (to the disbelievers) beforethey enter it, (plain to view) clear for them to see,

It is also said that thismeans: is it enough that the disbelievers choose to worship My servants as deities? (Lo! We have preparedhell as a welcome for the disbelievers).
18|103|(Say) O Muhammad: (Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works) in the Hereafter?
18|104|(Those whose effort goeth astray) those whose works are thwarted (in the life of the world) these are theKharijites; and it is also said that this refers to anchorites, (and yet they reckon that they do good work) andyet think that they are doing righteous works.

18|109|(Say) O Muhammad to the Jews: (Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord) for the knowledgeof my Lord, (verily the sea would be used up before the Words of my Lord were exhausted) it is also saidthat 'the Words of my Lord' means: the disposition of my Lord, (even though We brought the like thereof tohelp) as an addition.

This verse was revealed about JundubIbn Zuhayr al-'Amiri'.
19|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of (Kaf. Ha.Ya. Ain. Sad): '(Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ayn.

Hesays: Kaf means He is Sufficient (Kafi), Ha means He is the guiding One (Hadi), 'Ayn means He is Possessorof knowledge ('Alim), and Sad means He is Possessor of Truth (Sadiq); it is also said that Kaf means He isSufficient unto His servants, Ha means He guides His servants, Ya means His hand is above His creation,and 'Ayn means He knows the affairs of His servants, and Sad means He is true in His promise. It is alsosaid that Kaf is from the Generous (Karim), Ha is from the One who guides (Hadi), Ya is from Clement(Halim), 'Ayn from the One who possesses knowledge ('Alim), and Sad from the Truthful (Sadiq), or fromthe Veracious (Sudduq). It is also said that (Kaf. Ha. Ya. Ain. Sad) is an oath by means of which Allah swore.
19|2|(A mention of the mercy of your Lord) He says: this a mention of your Lord (unto His servant Zachariah) Hismercy unto him was by giving him a son.
19|3|(When he cried unto his Lord) Zachariah called his Lord in the sanctuary (a cry in secret) in secret from hispeople,
19|4|(Saying: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Lo! the bones of me wax feeble) my body has become weak (and my headis shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to You, my Lord) he said: my prayers werenever rejected by You, O my Lord.
19|5|(Lo! I fear my kinsfolk) i.e. the inheritors (after me) i.e. there is no one after me to inherit my office andposition, (since my wife) Hannah the sister of the mother of Mary the daughter of Amran ('Imran) the son ofMatthan (Mathan) (is barren) and gives birth to no children. (Oh, give me from Thy presence) from You (asuccessor) a son,
19|6|(Who shall inherit of me) who shall inherit my office and position (and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob) ifthey have an office and kingship, for the family of Jacob were John's maternal uncles. (And make him, myLord, acceptable (unto Thee)) make him well pleasing to you and righteous.
19|7|And so Gabriel called him, saying: (O Zachariah! Lo! We bring you tidings of a son whose name is John)Yahya in Arabic, because he has breathed life (ahya) into his mother's womb; (We have given the samename to none before (him)) We have not given before a son to Zachariah whose name is John; it is also saidthat this means: there was no one before him whose name was John.
19|8|(He said) Zachariah said to Gabriel: (My Lord!) my master, (How can I have a son when my wife is barrenand I have reached infirm old age) how can I have a son when my wife is barren and my body has becomedry?; it is also said that this means: how can I have a son when my wife is barren and I am seventy twoyears of age?
19|9|(He said) Gabriel said to him: (So (it will be)) just as I have told you. (Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me) i.e.his creation is easy for Me, (even as I created thee) O Zachariah (before) before John, (when thou wastnaught).
19|10|(He said: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Appoint for me some token) some sign when my wife becomes pregnant.(He said: Thy token is that thou, with no bodily defect, shall not speak unto mankind) will not be able tospeak to people (three nights) without suffering dumbness or any other illness.
19|11|(Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary) from the prayer hall, (and signified to them) hemade gestures to them; and it is also said: he wrote on the ground to them: (Glorify your Lord at break ofday and fall of night) pray to Him in the morning and at night.
19|12|(O John!) Allah said to John when he reached the age of puberty and understanding: (Hold the Scripture)act according to that which is in the Torah, seriously and diligently. (And We gave him) and We gave John(wisdom) understanding and knowledge (when a child) when he was still young.

19|18|(She said) Mary said: (Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing [taqiyya]) ifyou are obedient to the All-Merciful; it is also said that Taqiyy was the name of an evil man and she thoughtthat he was that man, which explains why she sought refuge in Allah from him.
19|19|(He said) Gabriel said to her: (I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee) that Allah maybestow on you (a faultless son) a righteous son.
19|20|(She said) Mary said to Gabriel (pbuh): (How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me) when nohusband has come near me, (neither have I been unchaste) neither have I been an adulteress!
19|21|(He said) Gabriel said to her: (So (it will be)) just as I have told you. (Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me) it iseasy for Me to create him without a father. (And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation) a tokenand admonition (for mankind) for the Children of Israel: a son without a father (and a mercy from Us) towhoever believes in him, (and it is a thing ordained) it is a thing decreed, that he shall be a son without afather.

19|26|(So eat) the date (and drink) from the stream (and be consoled) by the birth of Jesus (pbuh). (And if thoumeetest any mortal) and if you meet any human being, after today (say: Lo!

20|81|((Saying): Eat of the good things) of the lawful things (wherewith We have provided you) of manna andquails, (and transgress not in respect thereof) do not disbelieve in Him; it is also said that this means: donot save for the next day (lest My wrath) and torment (come upon you; and he on whom My wrath cometh)and he on whom my wrath and torment is decreed, (he is lost indeed) he is destroyed.
20|82|(And lo! verily I am Forgiving towards him who repenteth) from idolatry (and believeth) in Allah (and doethgood) with sincerity, (and afterward walketh aright) then truly sees the reward of his works; it is also saidthat this means: he is guided to the community of the orthodox faithful (ahl al-sunnah wa'l-jama'ah) anddies in that state.
20|83|When Moses was about to go with the seventy chosen men to the tryst, he hastened and went ahead ofthem; (And (it was said)) Allah said to him: (What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses?
20|84|He said: They are close upon my track) they are following in my track. And (I hastened unto Thee that Thoumightest be well pleased) so that Your good pleasure with me is increased.
20|85|(He said) O Moses! (Lo! We have tried thy folk) with the worship of the calf (in thine absence) after you setoff for the mountain, (and al-Samiri hath misled them) al-Samiri commanded them to do so.
20|86|(Then Moses went back) when Moses went back (unto his folk) with the 70 men and heard the sound of thesedition, he became (angry and sad. He said: O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise)a true promise? (Did the time appointed then appear too long for you) did I exceed the appointed time, (ordid ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you) should become prescribed upon you, (that yebroke tryst with me) that you went against my promise?
20|87|(They said) O Moses: (We broke not tryst with thee) we did not go against your promise (of our own will)intentionally knowing that we were doing so, (but we were laden with burdens) loads (of ornaments of thefolk) of the ornament of the people of Pharaoh, and the evil omen of that burden led us to worship the calf,(then cast them) then we cast the ornament ((in the Fire), for thus al-Samiri proposed) just as al-Samiri did.
20|88|(Then he produced for them) from the gold they threw in the Fire, al-Samiri made for them (a calf, ofsaffron hue) a small form without a spirit, (which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried) what is this?And al-Samiri said: (This is your God and the God of Moses, but he hath forgotten) al-Samiri abandonedAllah's worship and command; it is also said that this means: Moses left the way and took a wrong turn.
20|89|Allah then said: (See they not) i.e. al-Samiri and his host, (then, that it) the calf (returneth no saying untothem) does not answer them (and possesseth for them) and has no power (neither hurt) either to driveaway harm from them (nor use) or bring benefit to them?
20|90|(And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand) before the return of Moses (pbuh) to them: (O my people! Yeare but being seduced therewith) you have been tried with the lowing sound and the worship of the calf,(for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me) regarding His religion (and obey my order) obey my sayingand advice.
20|91|(They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries) we will continue to worship it (till Moses returnunto us).
20|92|When Moses returned, (He said) to Aaron: (O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them goneastray) from the right way,
20|93|(That thou followedst me not) that you failed to follow my advice and fight against them? (Hast thou thendisobeyed my order) have you then discarded my advice?
20|94|(He said) Aaron said to Moses: (O son of my mother) he mentioned their mother so that he be kind andcompassionate with him! (Clutch not my beard nor my head) nor my hair! (I feared lest thou shouldst say:Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel) if I had killed them, (and hast not waited for myword) and did not wait until I come back. This is why I refrained from fighting them.
20|95|Then Moses went to al-Samiri, and he (said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri?) What drove you toworship the calf, O Samiri?
20|96|(He said) al-Samiri said: (I perceived what they perceive not) I saw what the children of Israel did not see.Moses asked him: and what did you see that they did not? He said: I saw Gabriel riding a female horse,Balqa', the beast of life, (so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger) from the dust uponwhich Gabriel's horse stepped on, (and then threw it in) and threw it in the calf's mouth and behind. (Thusmy soul commended to me) thus did my soul entice me to do.
20|97|((Moses) said) to him: (Then go) O Samiri! (And lo! in this life) for as long as you live (it is for thee to say:Touch me not) you do not interact with anyone and no one will interact with you! (and lo! there is for you atryst) you have an appointed time on the Day of Judgement (thou canst not break) you cannot miss. (Nowlook upon your god of which thou hast remained a votary) look at the god which you worshipped. (Verily wewill burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea)
20|98|(Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God) He has no children or partners. (He embraceth allthings in His knowledge) He knows all things.
20|99|(Thus relate Who unto thee) in this way we sent you, O Muhammad, Gabriel with (some tidings of thatwhich happened of old) with the events of past nations, (and We have given thee from Our presence aReminder) We have honoured you with the Qur'an which contains the events of past and future generations.
20|100|(Whoso turneth away from it) whoever disbelieves in it, (he verily will bear a burden) idolatry (on the Day ofResurrection)
20|101|(Abiding under it) abiding in the punishment for committing idolatry, (an evil burden for them on the Day ofResurrection) their sins are an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,
20|102|(The day when the Trumpet is blown) i.e. on the first blowing of the Trumpet. (On that day we assemble theguilty) the idolaters (white-eyed) blind,
20|103|(Murmuring among themselves) saying to each other in murmur: (Ye have tarried) in the grave (but ten(days)).
20|104|(We are best aware of what they utter) regarding the resurrection (when their best in conduct) the best ofthem in intellect, the most sound of judgement and the most truthful in words (say: Ye have tarried) in yourgraves (but a day).
20|105|(They will ask thee) O Muhammad, Allah's blessings and peace be upon him. It was the Banu Thaqif whoasked him, (of the mountains (on that day)) they will ask you about the state of the mountains on the Dayof Judgement. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord will break them into scattered dust) Allah willcompletely uproot them.
20|106|(And leave it) and leave the earth (as an empty plain) without vegetation,
20|107|(Wherein thou seest neither curve) valleys or cleaves (nor ruggedness) nor plants or anything sprouting outof the earth.
20|108|(On that day) which is the Day of Judgement (they follow the summoner) they will all rush and go to thesummoner (who deceiveth not) they will turn neither to the right nor to the left, (and voices are hushed forthe Beneficent) out of awe for the Beneficent, (and thou hearest) O Muhammad (but a faint murmur).
20|109|(On that Day) the Day of Judgement (no intercession availeth) the angels will not intercede for anyone (save(that of) him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave) to intercede (and whose He accepteth) Heaccepts from him his saying: "there is no deity except Allah":
20|110|(He knoweth) Allah knows ((all) that is before them) all that is before the angels regarding the matter of theHereafter (and (all) that is behind them) and all that is behind them regarding the matter of this worldly life,(while they cannot compass it in knowledge) the angels know of that which is before them or behind themonly in the measure that Allah teaches them.
20|111|(And faces humble themselves) faces are lowered in this worldly life through prostration; it is also said thatthis means: the faces are humbled and submitted on the Day of Judgement (before the Living) Who diesnot, (the Eternal) Who has no beginning. (And he who beareth (a burden of) wrong-doing) idolatry (isindeed a failure (on that Day)) he loses on that Day.
20|112|(And he who hath done some good works) between him and his Lord, (being a believer) true in his faith, (hefears not injustice) he does not fear the thwarting of all his works (nor begrudging) nor the decrease of hisworks.
20|113|(Thus We have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic) We have sent down Gabriel with the Qur'an to Muhammad(pbuh) in the Arabic usage, (and have displayed therein) and have exposited in the Qur'an (certain threats)i.e. threats and promises, (that peradventure they may keep from evil) that perhaps they may ward offdisbelief, idolatry and indecencies (or that it may cause them to take heed) or obtain a reward if theybelieved; it is also said that this means: or obtain eminence through the profession of Allah's divineOneness; it is also said that this means: or incur chastisement if they did not believe.
20|114|(Then exalted be Allah, the True King) He exonerated Himself from having children or partners! (And hastennot with the Qur'an) do not hasten, O Muhammad, to recite the Qur'an (ere its revelation hath beenperfected unto thee) before Gabriel finishes reading the Qur'an to you. This is because when Gabriel used tobring new revelations, the Prophet (pbuh) would start to repeat them after Gabriel even before the latterfinished his reading, for fear of forgetting what was recited to him. Allah therefore told him to stop doingthis, saying: (and say) O Muhammad: (My Lord! Increase me in knowledge) and memorisation andunderstanding of the Qur'an as well as in judging by the Qur'an.
20|115|(And verily We made a covenant of old) before he ate from the tree; it is also said that this means: beforethe advent of Muhammad (pbuh) (with Adam) We commanded him not to eat from the tree, (but he forgot)he left what he was commanded to do, (and We found no constancy in him) We found in him no firmness orresoluteness.
20|116|(And when We said unto the angels) Who were on the earth: (Fall prostrate before Adam) a prostration ofgreeting, (they fell prostrate (all) save Iblis) their chief; (he refused) he felt too proud to prostrate beforeAdam.
20|117|(Therefore We said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto your wife) Eve, (so let him not drive youboth out of the Garden) if you obey him (so that thou come to toil) and toil as a consequence.
20|118|(It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein) in Paradise (nor are naked,
20|119|And that thou thirstest not therein nor are exposed to the sun's heat) He says: you are not going to sweat.
20|120|(But the Devil whispered to him) to eat of the tree, (saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree ofimmortality) whoever eats from it will live for ever and shall never die (and power that wasteth not away)and will remain holding on to a power that will never cease?
20|121|(Then they twain ate thereof) Adam and Eve ate from the tree, (so that their shame became apparent untothem) so that their nakedness appeared to them, (and they began) intentionally (to hide by heaping onthemselves) by covering their nakedness with (some of the leaves of the Garden) some of the leaves of figtrees; whenever they put some on them, they fell off. (And Adam disobeyed his Lord) by eating from thetree, (so went astray) he left the way of guidance, and did not get what he wanted when he ate from thetree.
20|122|(Then his Lord chose him) by means of repentance, (and relented towards him) He overlooked his sin, (andguided him) to repentance.
20|123|(He said: Go down hence) from Paradise, (both of you) along with serpent and the peacock, (one of you afoe unto the other) i.e. the children of Adam and the serpent are foes to one another. (But if there comeunto you from Me a guidance) when it comes to you, O Children of Adam, guidance from Me: a Scriptureand a Messenger, (then whoso followeth My guidance) My Scripture and Messenger, (he will not go astray)by following them in the life of this world (nor come to grief) in the Hereafter.
20|124|(But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me) but he who turns from professing My divine Oneness;it is also said that this means: he who disbelieves in My Scripture and Messenger, (his will be a narrow life)he will be exposed to a severe punishment in the grave; and it is also said: he will be exposed to a severepunishment in hell, (and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection.
20|125|He will say: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Wherefore hast Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when I was wont tosee) in the life of this world?
20|126|(He will say: So (it must be)). Because (Our revelations) Our Scripture and Messenger (came unto thee butthou didst forget them) you abstained from believing in them or acting upon them. (In like manner thou artforgotten this Day) you will be left in hell.
20|127|(Thus do We reward him who is prodigal) him who associates partners with Allah (and believeth not therevelations of his Lord) i.e. the Scripture and the Messenger; (and verily the doom of the Hereafter will besterner and more lasting) than the torment of this worldly life.
20|128|(Is it not a guidance for them (to know)) has it not been explained to the people of Mecca (how many ageneration) past generations (We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings they walk? Lo! Therein) inthat which We did to them (verily are signs for men of thought) for men possessed of sound intellects.
20|129|(And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord) that their punishment shall be postponed,(and a term already fixed) for this nation, (the judgement would (have) been inevitable (in this world)) theirpunishment would have been inevitable.
20|130|(Therefore, bear with what they say) bear, O Muhammad, all their insults and denial; this verses washowever abrogated by the verses of fighting, (and celebrate the praises of thy Lord) pray, O Muhammad, bythe command of your Lord (ere the rising of the sun) the morning prayer (and ere the going down thereof.And glorify Him) pray the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers (some hours of the night) after the advent of the night(and at the two ends of the day) the prayers of Zuhr and 'Asr, (that thou mayst find acceptance) that youmay be given the intercession and be pleased thereby.
20|131|(And strain not your eyes) do not look out of desire (towards that which We cause some wedded pairs) men(among them) among the people of Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir (to enjoy) wealth, (the flower of thelife of the world) the adornment of this worldly life, (that We may try them thereby) that We may try themwith that adornment which We have given them. (The provision of thy Lord) Paradise (is better and morelasting) than that which they have in this worldly life.
20|132|(And enjoin upon thy people worship) in the time of hardship, (and be constant therein) be steadfast inprayer. (We ask not of thee a provision) We do not ask you to be the provider of yourself or your family:(We provide for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness) Paradise is for the person who wards off disbelief,idolatry and indecencies.
20|133|(And they say) i.e. the people of Mecca: (If only he would bring us) why does not Muhammad bring us (amiracle) a sign (from his Lord! Hath there not come unto them the proof) the exposition (of what is in theformer Scriptures) what is in the Torah and the Gospel for they contained the attributes and description ofthe Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)?
20|134|(And if We had destroyed them) i.e. the people of Mecca (with some punishment before it) before theProphet Muhammad (pbuh) came with the Qur'an, (they would assuredly have said) on the Day ofJudgement: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (If only Thou hadst sent unto us) why did You not send us (amessenger, so that we might have followed Your revelations) so that we you follow your Messenger andbelieve in Your Book (before we were (thus) humbled) before we were killed at Badr (and disgraced!) andtormented by the torment of the Day of Judgement.
20|135|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Each) one of us and you (is awaiting) the destruction of his opponent; (soawait ye! Ye will come to know) upon the advent of chastisement on the Day of Judgement (who are theowners of the path of equity) the path of justice, (and who is right) and who among us is guided to faith'.
21|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding the meaning of Allah, Exalted isHe, saying: (Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind): He says: the chastisement that the people of Meccawere promised in the Book has drawn near, (while they turn away in heedlessness) while they are obliviousto it; they have disbelieved in and discarded it.
21|2|(Never cometh there unto them) whenever Gabriel comes to their Prophet with (a new reminder from theirLord) i.e. the Qur'an: verse after verse and surah after surah, as if the coming of Gabriel, time after time,and the recitation of Muhammad (pbuh) and their listening to it are new, not that the Qur'an is new, (butthey listen to it while they play) while they mock Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an.
21|3|(With hearts preoccupied) with hearts heedless of the matter of the Hereafter. (And they confer in secret)they hide among themselves their disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. (The wrong-doers)these are the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host; they say to one another: (say: Is this) they mean Muhammad(pbuh) (other than a mortal like you) other than a human being like you? (Will ye then succumb to magic)will you then believe in magic and lies (when ye see (it)) while knowing that it is magic and lies?
21|4|(He saith) Muhammad says to them: (My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth) Allahknows the secret words that the dwellers of the heaven and the earth say and the secret works they do. (Heis the Hearer) of what Abu Jahl and his host say, (the Knower) of Abu Jahl and his host as well as of theirpunishment.
21|5|(Nay, say they) some of them say, ((these are but) muddled dreams) false dreams, that which Muhammad(pbuh) brought to us is but false dreams; (nay, he hath but invented it) some others say: Muhammad(pbuh) invented the Qur'an; (nay, he is but a poet) some of them said: no, he is a poet. (Let him bring us aportent) a sign (even as those of old (who were God's messengers) were sent (with portents)) just as themessengers of old were sent with signs to their people, as he claims.
21|6|Allah then says: (Not a township) not a single population of a township (believed of those which Wedestroyed) when they disbelieved in the signs (before them) before your people: (would they then believe)would your people then believe in the signs? Nay, they will not.
21|7|(And We sent not (as Our messengers) before you other than men) human beings like you (whom Weinspired) to whom We sent angels just as We have sent to you. (Ask the followers of the Reminder) thepeople of the Torah and the Gospel (if you know not) that Allah sent only human messengers?
21|8|(We gave them not) i.e. the Prophet (bodies that would not eat food) or drink, (nor were they immortals) inthis worldly life. Rather, they ate and drank and died. This verse was revealed about the people of Meccawhen they said: how come this Messenger eats food and walks in the marketplace?
21|9|(Then We fulfilled the promise unto them) We fulfilled the promise given to the prophets that they will besaved. (So We delivered them) i.e. the prophets (and whom We would) and those who believed in theprophets, (and We destroyed the prodigals) and We destroyed the idolaters.
21|10|(Now We have revealed unto you) unto your Prophet (a Scripture) We sent Gabriel with a Scripture (whereinis your Reminder) wherein lies your eminence and dignity if you believe in it. (Have ye then no sense) doyou not believe then in your eminence and dignity?
21|11|(How many a community that dealt unjustly) whose people were disbelievers and idolaters (have Weshattered) have We destroyed, (and raised up) and created (after them) after their destruction (anotherfolk) who lived in their habitations!
21|12|(And, when they felt Our might) when they saw Our chastisement which was to destroy them, (behold themfleeing from it) they run away from Our might!
21|13|The angels said to them: (Flee not) do not run away, (but return to that (existence) which emasculated you)return to the comfort which you enjoyed (and to your dwellings) and to your houses, (that ye may bequestioned) about faith; it is also said that this means: that you may be asked about the killing of theProphet (pbuh).
21|14|(They cried) when they were being killed and tormented: (Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers) when wekilled our Prophet.
21|15|(And this their crying) i.e. saying "Alas for us!" (ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct) dead,motionless. This is the story of a township near Yemen called "Hudur". Allah sent a prophet to them but theykilled him. Allah set on them Nebuchadnezzar who exterminated them.
21|16|(We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them) of created beings (in play) withoutordaining commands and prohibitions.
21|17|Then Allah revealed the following, when they said that the angels are Allah's daughters: (If We had wishedto find a pastime) if We wished to have daughters; and it is said that this means: if We wished to have awife; and it is also said that this means: if We wished to have children, (We could have found it in Ourpresence) from Us from among the maidens of Paradise (if We ever did) and We will never do this.
21|18|(Nay, but We hurl the true) We cast the Truth (against the false) upon falsehood; it is also said: We expositthe Truth and falsehood, (and it doth break its head) and it makes it perish (and lo! it vanisheth) i.e.falsehood. (And yours) O group of disbelievers (will be woe) severe punishment (for that which ye ascribe(unto Him)) for your claim that the angels are Allah's daughters.
21|19|(Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth) all created beings are His slaves.

21|20|(They glorify (Him) night and day) they pray to Him at night and during the day; (they flag not) they do notget bored of worshipping Allah and of acknowledging His Lordship.
21|21|(Or have they chosen) or have they, i.e. the people of Mecca, worshipped (gods from the earth) on theearth (who raise the dead) or create human beings?
21|22|(If there were therein) in the heavens and earth (Gods beside Allah) other than Allah, (then verily both hadbeen disordered) the dwellers of the heavens and the earth would have been destroyed. (Glorified be Allah,the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe (unto Him)) from the children and partners they ascribe toAllah.
21|23|(He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth) Allah will not be questioned about what He says,commands or does, (but they will be questioned) and the servants will be asked about what they say anddo.
21|24|(Or have they chosen) or have they worshipped (other gods) idols (beside Him) beside Allah? (Say) to them,O Muhammad: (Bring your proof (of their godhead)) bring your proofs for the validity of their worship.(This) i.e. the Qur'an (is the Reminder of those with me) is the events of those with me (and those beforeme) and the events of those who were before among the believers and disbelievers, and it does not containthat Allah has children or partners, (but most of them) all of them (know not the Truth) nor believe inMuhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and so they are averse) they disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in theQur'an.
21|25|(And We sent no messenger before you) O Muhammad (but We inspired him) tell your people that theyshould say: (There is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me) so declare My divine Oneness.
21|26|(And they say) i.e. the people of Mecca: (The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a child) angels asdaughters. (Be He glorified!) Allah exonerated Himself from having children or partners (Nay, but arehonoured slaves) rather they are, i.e. the angels, are servants whom Allah has honoured with obeying Him;
21|27|(They speak not until He hath spoken) Gabriel does not go ahead of Michael, whether by words or acts, untilHe commands him, (and they act by His command) and they, i.e. the angels, say and do in accordance withAllah's command.
21|28|(He knoweth what is before them) of the matter of the Hereafter (and what is behind them) of the matter ofthis worldly life, (and they) i.e. the angels (cannot intercede) on the Day of Judgement (except for himwhom He accepteth) except for those who profess Allah's divine Oneness and with whose monotheism Allahis pleased, (and they quake for awe of Him) among those who fear Him.
21|29|(And one of them) of the angels; and it is said this means: of created beings (who should say: Lo! I am aGod beside Him) beside Allah, (that one We should repay with hell) Hell will be his lot because of this. (ThusWe repay wrong-doers) thus We repay disbelievers.
21|30|(Have not those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (known that the heavens and theearth were of one piece) We did not send down to it a drop of rain or grow vegetation on the earth whichwere aligned with each other (then We parted them) and then separated them and singled them out fromeach other through rain and plants, (and We made every living thing of water) We made of water from themale and female everything that requires water? (Will they) i.e. the people of Mecca (not then believe) inMuhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an?
21|31|(And We have placed in the earth firm hills) the mountains as pillars for it (lest it quake with them) lest theearth trembles with them on it, (and We have placed therein) in the earth (ravines) valleys (as roads) asspacious roads (that haply they may find their way) in their goings and comings.
21|32|(And We have made the sky a roof) for the earth (withheld (from them)) such that it does not fall; it is alsosaid that this means: it is protected from the satans by the stars.

And they would deny all mention of the Beneficent) theydeny the Beneficent, saying: we do not know anyone by the name of the Beneficent (al-Rahman) exceptMusaylimah, the liar.
21|37|(Man) i.e. Adam (is made of haste) he is hasty; it is also said that this means: man, al-Nadr Ibn al-Harth,was created hasty, for he wanted chastisement to be hastened for him.

And so wasrevealed the passage: (whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein) towards anyone, (him We shall causeto taste a painful doom) such that he is not given food, drink or shelter until he leaves the Sacred Precinctand the legal punishment is applied on him.
22|26|(And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham) when We explained to Abraham (the place of the (holy)House) by means of a cloud which had stopped close to him, and so he built the House by the side wherebythe cloud stopped. And We inspired him (saying: Ascribe thou no thing) no idols (as partner unto Me, andpurify My House) purify My Mosque from idols (for those who make the round (thereof) and those whostand) and those who live there (and those who bow and make prostration) the people who pray from allcountries and from wherever they happen to come.
22|27|(And proclaim unto mankind) call your offspring for (the Pilgrimage. They will come unto you) so that theycome to you (on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine) from every road andremote land.
22|28|(That they may witness things that are of benefit to them) the benefits of this worldly life and the benefits ofthe Hereafter; the benefit of the Hereafter through supplications and worship and the benefit of this worldlylife through trade and making profit (and mention the name of Allah) and so that they mention the name ofAllah (on appointed days) on well known days, the days of tashriq (over the beast of cattle that He hathbestowed upon them) the beast of cattle offered for immolation. (Then eat thereof) eat from the beasts ofcattle you immolated (and feed therewith the poor unfortunate).
22|29|(Then let them make an end of their unkemptness) and then let them complete the rites of their pilgrimage:shaving their heads, throwing pebbles, cutting their nails and other things (and pay their vows) and fulfilthat which they made incumbent upon themselves (and go around) the obligated circumambulation (theancient House) more ancient than any tyrant that has ever stepped on its soil; it is also said that this means:more ancient than the flood of Noah; it is also said that it is the first House ever built; and it is also said thatwhoever go round it will be delivered.
22|30|(That (is the command)) that which I have mentioned of rites, they have to fulfil it. (And whoso magnifieththe sacred things of Allah) i.e. the rites of the pilgrimage, (it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord) interms of reward. (The cattle) the immolated cattle and the eating of their meat (are lawful unto you savethat which has been told you) in Surah al-Ma'idah such as carrion, blood and pork. (So shun the filth ofidols) so leave the drinking of intoxicants and the worship of idols, (and shun lying speech) and abstain fromuttering falsehood and lies. This is because they used to say during their pilgrimage in the pre-Islamic time:"here we are, O Lord, here we are, you have no partners except for a partner that you possess and itpossesses not", and so Allah forbade them from saying this.
22|31|(Turning unto Allah (only)) be sincere to Allah in your chanting and pilgrimage, (not ascribing partners untoHim) in your chanting or pilgrimage; (for whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen fromthe sky and the birds had snatched him) to take him wherever they wish (or the wind had blown him to afar-off place).
22|32|(That) i.e. being thrown away far off is the lot of he who associates partners with Allah. (And whosomagnifieth the offerings consecrated to Allah) and whoever magnifies the rites of pilgrimage, and thusimmolates the fattest and biggest beast of cattle, (it) the immolation of the fattest and biggest beast ofcattle (surely is from devotion of the hearts) is due to the limpidity of the person's heart and his sincerity.
22|33|(Therein) in the cattle (are benefits for you) benefits in riding them and drinking their milk (for an appointedterm) until they are garlanded and designated for immolation in the pilgrimage; (and afterward they arebrought for sacrifice unto the ancient House) if this is a lesser pilgrimage, and they are brought for sacrificeto Mina during the greater pilgrimage.
22|34|(And for every nation) of believers (have We appointed a ritual) a location for slaughtering their sacrifices inthe lesser and greater pilgrimages, (that they may mention the name of Allah over the beast of cattle) whichis sacrificed (that He hath given them for food; and your God is One God) without a son or partner,(therefore surrender unto Him) be sincere to Him in worship and profession of His divine Oneness.

22|36|(And the camels!) and bovines (We have appointed them) We have made them subservient to you (amongthe ceremonies of Allah) among the rites of the pilgrimage so that you immolate them. (Therein) in thesesacrifices (ye have much good) you have much reward. (So mention the name of Allah over them when theyare drawn up in lines) when you immolate them, and let them be free of defects; it is also said that thismeans: they should have their left foot tied up such that they stand on three. (Then when their flanks fall(dead)) after immolating them, (eat thereof) of the meat of these sacrifices (and feed the beggar) who iscontent with little (and the supplicant) the one who faces you but does not beg of you. (Thus have We madethem subject unto you, that haply ye may give thanks) that you may give thanks to His bounty anddispensation.
22|37|(Their flesh and their blood reach not Allah) because in the pre-Islamic time they used to splash the blood ofsacrifices on the walls of the Holy House and sully themselves with this blood and so Allah forbade themfrom doing so; it is also said that this means: Allah does not accept their flesh or blood, (but the devotionfrom you reacheth Him) but He accepts your pure and sincere works. (Thus have We made them subjectunto ye that you may magnify Allah that He hath guided you) as He guided you to His religion and wont.(And give good tidings to the good) to those who are good in their words and deeds; and it is said that thegood means: the generous with their sacrifices.
22|38|(Lo! Allah defendeth those who are true) Allah defends those who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and in theQur'an against the disbelievers of Mecca. (Lo! Allah loveth not each treacherous ingrate) who disbelieves inAllah.
22|39|(Sanction is given unto those who fight) sanction has been given to the believers to fight the disbelievers ofMecca (because they have been wronged) the disbelievers of Mecca wronged them; (and Allah is indeedAble to give them victory) Allah is able to give the believers victory over their enemies;

(For had it not been for Allah'srepelling some men by means of others) and so He checks by means of the prophets the believers. Andthrough the believers He checks the disbelievers, and through the fighters He checks those who do not takepart in fighting; if it had not been for this (cloisters) the cloisters of monks (and churches) of the Jews (andoratories) the Magians' houses of fire, because these were safe from Muslims (and mosques) of the Muslims,(wherein the name of Allah is oft mentioned) repeating the formulas: "Allah is the greatest" and "there is nodeity except Allah", (would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth one) against his enemies(who helpeth Him) who helps His Prophet in jihad. (Lo! Allah is Strong) to help His Prophet and whoeverhelps His Prophet, (Almighty) He is Mighty in His vengeance against the enemies of His Prophet.
22|41|(Those who, if We give them power in the land) We make them dwell in the land of Mecca, (establishworship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from their wealth (and enjoin kindness) andenjoin Allah's divine Oneness and the following of Muhammad (pbuh) (and forbid iniquity) and forbiddisbelief, idolatry and disobedience of the Messenger.

(For indeed it) seeing without reflection; it is also said that "it"here refers to the expression of idolatry (is not the eyes that grow blind) such that it ceases to see physicalobjects, (but it is the hearts which are within the bosoms, that grow blind) from the Truth and guidance.

22|78|(And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right) and fulfil for Allah that which is His right.

The latter are the oneswho inherit Paradise, rather than the disbelievers; it is also said that this means: the believers will be safedue to their faith, and felicity is manifested in two ways: success and permanence.
23|2|Then Allah mentioned the traits of the believers, saying: (Who are humble in their prayers) turning neitherto the right nor to the left, nor raise their hands while praying,

23|30|(Lo! Herein) in that which We did to them (verily are portents) are signs and admonitions for the people ofMecca in order for them to emulate, (for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the test) with misfortunes;and it is also said that this means: with punishment.
23|31|(Then, after them) after the destruction of Noah's people, (We brought forth another generation) differentpeople;
23|32|(And We sent among them) and We sent to them (a messenger of their own) of their own lineage (saying:Serve Allah) saying: declare Allah's divine Oneness. (Ye have no other god save Him) you have no other godexcept the One in Whom I command you to believe. (Will ye not ward off (evil)) the worship of other thanAllah?
23|33|(And the chieftains of his folk) of the folk of the messenger, (who disbelieved and denied the meeting of theHereafter) and disbelieved in resurrection after death, (and whom We had made soft) whom We blessedwith wealth and offspring (in the life of the world, said: This) i.e. this Messenger (is only a mortal) a humanbeing (like you, who eateth of that whereof you eat) who eats as you eat (and drinketh of that ye drink) anddrinks as you do.
23|34|(If ye were to obey a mortal) a human being (like yourselves, ye surely would be losers) you would beignorant and losers.
23|35|(Doth he) does this Messenger (promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust) after death(and bones) and decayed bones, (will (again) be brought forth) will be brought back to life after death?
23|36|(Be gone, be gone, with that which ye are promised!) how farfetched, how farfetched! This will never be.
23|37|(There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live) the fathers die and their children live, (and weshall not be raised (again)) after we die.
23|38|(He is only a man) they mean the Messenger is only a man (who hath invented a lie about Allah) in thatwhich he says. (We are not going to put faith in him) we are not going to believe what he says.
23|39|(He said) the Messenger said: (My Lord! Help me) by sending punishment on them (because they deny me)because they disbelieve in my message,
23|40|(He said) Allah said: (In a little while they surely will become repentant) they will regret their disbelief whenthe chastisement seizes them.
23|41|(So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully) i.e. the punishment, which is the cry of Gabriel, seized them,(and We made them) when the chastisement stopped (like a wreckage (that a torrent hurls). A far removal)an utter destruction and disappointment for failing to obtain Allah's mercy (for wrong-doing folk!) for thedisbelievers.
23|42|(Then after them) then after their destruction (We brought forth other generations) from generation togeneration.
23|43|(No nation can outstrip its term) no nation can bring forward the term appointed for its destruction, (nor yetpostpone it) to a later date.
23|44|(Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they deniedhim) they denied that messenger; (so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster)) withchastisement (and We made them bywords) We made them the talk of their time. (A far removal) what adisappointment for failing to obtain Allah's mercy (for folk who believe not!) for people who disbelieve inMuhammad (pbuh).
23|45|(Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our) nine (tokens and a clear warrant) and a clear proof.
23|46|(Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them)) they were too proud to believe in Moses and thesigns (and they were despotic folk) they opposed Moses and felt too proud to believe.
23|47|(And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals) two human beings, meaning Moses and Aaron (likeourselves, and whose folk are servile unto us) while their people are our obedient servants?
23|48|(So they denied them) they denied their message, (and became of those who were destroyed) they weredrowned in the sea.
23|49|(And we verily gave Moses the Scripture) the Torah, (that haply they might go aright) that haply they mightbe led to guidance.
23|50|(And We made the son of Mary) i.e. Jesus (and his mother a portent) a sign and admonition: a son withouta father and a pregnancy without physical contact, (and We gave them refuge on a height) on an elevatedlocation, (a place of flocks and water springs) the reference here is to Damascus.
23|51|(O ye messengers!) the reference here is to Muhammad (Eat of the good thing) eat of the lawful things,(and do right) do righteous works between yourself and your Lord. (Lo! I am Aware) I am aware of thereward (of what ye do) of what you do, O Muhammad, and also of what they do.
23|52|(And lo! this your religion is one religion) and your belief is one chosen belief (and I am your Lord) One soleLord who honoured you with it, (so keep your duty unto Me) so obey Me.
23|53|(But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects) so they split among themselves withregard to religion into different groups: groups of Jews, Christians, idolaters and Magians, (each sect) theadherents of each religion and sect (rejoicing in its tenets) being impressed with what they have.
23|54|(So leave them) O Muhammad (in their error) in their ignorance (till a time) until the advent of punishmenton the Day of Badr.
23|55|(Think they) do the adherents of these sects think (that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them)in the life of this world,
23|56|(We hasten unto them with good things) in this world; and it is said: in the Hereafter? (Nay, but theyperceive not) that We provide them in the life of this world but will humiliate them in the Hereafter.
23|57|Then Allah clarified to whom He hastens with good things in the life of this world, saying: (Lo! those who goin awe for fear of their Lord) of their Lord's chastisement; for these We hasten with good things;
23|58|(And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, for these Wehasten with good things;
23|59|(And those who ascribe not partners) idols (unto their Lord) for these We hasten with good things;
23|60|(And those who give that which they give) of their wealth for alms and spend of it in the way of Allah; and itis said that this means: those who do what they do of righteous deeds (with hearts afraid because they areabout to return unto their Lord) in the Hereafter, fearing that perhaps their works will not be accepted,
23|61|(These) who have such traits (race for the good things) hasten to perform righteous works, (and they shallwin them in the race.
23|62|And We task not any soul) with works (beyond its scope) beyond its capability, (and with Us is a Record)this is the Record of the recording angels (al-hafazah) who record people's good and bad works (whichspeaketh the Truth) they will testify truthfully and fairly, (and they will not be wronged) their good deedswill not be diminished and their bad works will not be increased.
23|63|(Nay, but their hearts) the hearts of the people of Mecca: i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (are in ignorance) andheedlessness (of this) Qur'an, (and they have other works) decreed upon them, (besides) besides that whichyou enjoin them of good works, (which they are doing) in the life of this world until their appointed timecomes, O Muhammad;
23|64|(Till when We grasp their luxurious ones) their tyrants and leaders: Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi, al-'As Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi, 'Utbah and Shaybah and their friends (with thepunishment) with hunger for seven years, (behold! they supplicate) they plead.
23|65|Say to them, O Muhammad: (Supplicate not this day) to escape Our punishment! (Assuredly you will not behelped) you will not be saved (by Us) from Our punishment.
23|66|(My revelations) the Qur'an (were recited) and shown (unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels) toyour initial religion,
23|67|(In scorn thereof) feeling haughty because of the Holy House, claiming that you are its guardians. (Nightlydid you rave together) you cursed Muhammad (pbuh) his Companions and the Qur'an in your nightlygatherings.
23|68|(Have they not pondered the Word) have they not reflected upon the Qur'an and that which it contains ofthreats, (or hath that come unto them) upon the people of Mecca, of safety and freedom from obligation(which came not unto their fathers of old?
23|69|Or know they not their messenger) the lineage of their Messenger, (and so reject him) and so deny him?
23|70|(Or say they) indeed they say: (There is a madness in him? Nay, but he bringeth them the Truth)Muhammad (pbuh) brought them the Qur'an, the profession of Allah's divine Oneness and the Message;(and most of them are haters) deniers (of the Truth) of the Qur'an.
23|71|(And if the Truth had followed their desires) if it was according to their whims such that there is a deity inthe heavens and a deity in the earth, (verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein) of createdbeings (had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their Reminder) We sent Gabriel to their Prophetwith the Qur'an wherein lies their glory and honour, (but from their Reminder) but from their glory andhonour (they now turn away) they disbelieve.
23|72|(Or dost thou ask of them) or do you ask, O Muhammad, the people of Mecca (any tribute) some payment,and this is why they are not responding? (But! the bounty of your Lord) in Paradise (is better) is better thanwhat they have in the life of this world, (for He is best of all who make provision) in this world and in thenext.
23|73|(And lo! thou) O Muhammad (summonest them indeed unto a right path) to an established religion whichAllah is pleased with: Islam.
23|74|(And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter) those who do not believe in resurrection after death (areindeed astray from the path) from Allah's religion.
23|75|(Though We had mercy on them) i.e. the people of Mecca (and relieved them of the harm) and relievedthem of the hunger which was (afflicting them, they still would wander blindly on) they still would carry onblind to the Truth and guidance (in their contumacy) in their disbelief and error.
23|76|(Already have We grasped them with punishment) with hunger and drought, (but they humble notthemselves unto their Lord) but they did not submit themselves to their Lord by professing Allah's divineOneness, (nor do they pray) nor do they believe,
23|77|(Until) give them respite, O Muhammad, until (when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment) i.e.of hunger, (behold! they are aghast thereat) they despair of all goodness.
23|78|(He it is Who hath created for you) O people of Mecca (ears) with which to hear (and eyes) with which tosee (and hearts) with which to comprehend. (Small thanks give ye) your thanks for all the things you havebeen given, O people of Mecca, is small!
23|79|(And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast) created you (in the earth, and unto Him ye will be gathered)after you die, and then He will requite you according to your works.
23|80|(And He it is Who giveth life) upon resurrection (and causes death) in the life of this world, (and His is thedifference of night and day) He changes the day and the night; He makes them come and go, increase anddecrease in length; the brightness of day and darkness of night-all these are a sign that Allah will bring thedead back to life. (Have ye then no sense) do you then not believe in resurrection after death?
23|81|(Nay, but they) i.e. the people of Mecca (say the like of that which) disbelieve in resurrection after death inthe same was as (said the men of old) the people of old disbelieved in resurrection after death;
23|82|(They say: When we are dead and have become mere) scattered (dust and) decayed (bones, shall we then,forsooth, be raised again) after we have died?
23|83|(We were already promised this) which you are promising us, O Muhammad, (we and our forefathers)before us, were also promised the same. (Lo! This) that which you are saying to us, O Muhammad, (isnaught but fables) the mere talk and lies (of the men of old.
23|84|(Say) O Muhammad: (Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein) of created beings;answer me, (if ye have knowledge?)
23|85|(They will say: Unto Allah. Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Will ye not then remember) will you not then takeheed and obey Allah?
23|86|(Say) also to them, O Muhammad: (Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne?
23|87|They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth)) Allah created them. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Will ye notthen keep duty (unto Him)) will you then not avoid the worship of other than Him?
23|88|(Say) also to them, O Muhammad: (In Whose hand is the dominion over all things) in Whose hand is thestore of all things (and He protecteth) and He judges, (while against Him there is no protection) while nojudgement can be made upon him; it is also said that this means: He protects people from His chastisementbut none can protect others from His chastisement, (if ye have knowledge?
23|89|They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth)) all that is through Allah's power. (Say) to them, OMuhammad: (How then are ye bewitched) then why do you lie about Allah; it is also said that this means,according to a different reading: see, O Muhammad, how they turn away because of lies?
23|90|(Nay, but We have brought them the Truth) We sent Gabriel to their Prophet with the Qur'an in which it isstated that Allah has no son or partner, (and lo! they are liars) when they say the angels are Allah'sdaughters.
23|91|(Allah hath not chosen any son) from the Children of Adam nor are the angels His daughters, (nor is thereany God along with Him) as partner; (else would) if the case was as they claim then (each God haveassuredly championed that which he created) each god would take for himself that which he created, (andsome of them would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah) Allah exonerated Himself (above allthat they allege) of all their lies.
23|92|(Knower of the invisible) that which is unseen by people; it is also said the invisible includes everything thatwill happen in the future (and the visible!) that which people know; it is also said that the visible includeseverything that has already happened (and exalted be He over) Allah is far transcendent above (all that theyascribe as partners (unto Him)) of idols!
23|93|(Say) O Muhammad: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised) ofchastisement,
23|94|(My Lord! then set me not among the wrong-doing folk) do not place me with the disbelieving people on theDay of Badr.
23|95|(And verily We are Able to show thee) O Muhammad (that which We have promised them) of torment onthe Day of Badr.
23|96|(Repel evil with that which is better) repel by means of "there is no god except Allah" the expression ofidolatry which is coming from Abu Jahl and his host; and it is also said that this means: repel from yourselftheir indecent talk through the greeting of peace. (We are best Aware of that which they allege) of lies.
23|97|(And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions) from the insinuations (of the evil ones) thatbewitch humans,

(It) his saying: "Return me that Imay do right" (is but a word that he speaketh) is just a mere expression that he utters and which will notbenefit him; (and behind them) in front of them (is a barrier) the grave (until the day when they are raised)from the graves.
23|101|(And when the trumpet is blown) the blowing of the resurrection (there will be no kinship among them)people's common lineage will be of no benefit (that day) the Day of Judgement, (nor will they ask of oneanother) nor will they ask about that.

23|103|(And those whose scales are light) with good works (are those who lose their souls, in hell abiding) forever,neither to die or leave.
23|104|(The fire burneth their faces) their faces are beaten up, and their flesh and bones are consumed by the Fire,(and they are glum) their faces are dark and their eyes blue (therein) in hell.
23|105|Allah says to them: (Were not My revelations) the Qur'an (recited unto you) in the life of the world, (andthen ye used to deny them) and you used to disbelieve in the revelations?
23|106|(They will say) the disbelievers will say upon entering hell: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Our evil fortune) whichwas decreed upon us in the Guarded Tablet (conquered us) this is why we did not believe, (and we wereerring folk) and we were disbelievers.
23|107|(Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Oh, bring us forth from hence) take us out of hell! (If we return) to disbelief (thenindeed we shall be wrong-doers) then we will be transgressing against ourselves.
23|108|(He saith) Allah says to them: (Be gone therein) be abased in hell, (and speak not unto Me) and do not askMe to get you out of hell.
23|109|(Lo! there was a party of My) believing (slaves who said: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (We believe) in You, in YourMessenger and in Your Book, (therefore forgive us) our sins (and have mercy on us) by not punishing us(for Thou art Best of all who show mercy) You are more merciful towards us than our own parents;
23|110|(But ye chose them from a laughing stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me) until theypreoccupied you from declaring My divine Oneness and worshipping Me, (while ye laughed at them) andmocked them.
23|111|(Lo! I have rewarded them this day) with Paradise (forasmuch as they were steadfast) in obeying me andwithholding your harm; (and they verily are the triumphant) they have gained Paradise and become safefrom hell. This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his host who mocked Salman [al-Farisi] and hisfellow-believers
23|112|(He will say) Allah will say to them: (How long tarried you) how long have you remained (in the earth) inyour graves, (counting by years) how many days and months?
23|113|(They will say: We tarried but a day) upon saying this, they will have some doubt, and therefore will say: (orpart of a day). Then, they said: we do not know: (Ask of those who keep count!) i.e. the angels who recordpeople's deeds; it is also said that this refers to the angel of death and his helpers.
23|114|(He will say) Allah will say to them: (Ye tarried) you remained in your graves (but a little) in comparison toyour dwelling in hell (if ye only knew) this; He says: if you only believe what I say; it is also said that thismeans: if only you did believe in My prophets in the life of the world, you would know now that youremained in your graves but a short time.
23|115|(Deemed ye then) O people of Mecca (that We had created you for naught) in vain, without commands andprohibitions, reward and punishment, (and that ye would not be returned unto Us) after you die?
23|116|(Now Allah be exalted) Allah is exonerated from and far above having a son or partner, (the True King!There is no God save Him, the Lord of the Throne of Grace.

(His reckoning) his chastisement (is only with his Lord) in the Hereafter.(Lo! disbelievers will not be successful) disbelievers will not be safe from Allah's chastisement nor escapefrom it.
23|118|(And say) O Muhammad: (My Lord! Forgive) my nation (and have mercy) on my nation by not punishingthem, (for Thou art Best of all who show mercy) the most Merciful of all who show mercy'.
24|1|And from his own narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying ((Here is) a surah which We have revealed): '((Here is) a surah which We have revealed) He says:We sent Gabriel with it (and enjoined) We exposited in it the lawful and the unlawful, (and wherein We haverevealed plain tokens) containing commands and prohibitions, obligations and legal punishments, (that haplyye may take heed) that you may take admonition in the commands and prohibitions, so do not suspend theapplication of legal punishments.
24|2|(The adulterer and the adulteress) who are unmarried and have not been married before, (scourge ye eachone of them (with) a hundred stripes) flog each one of them a hundred times. (And let not pity for thetwain) for applying the legal punishment (withhold you from obedience to Allah) withhold you fromexecuting Allah's legal ruling on them, (if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day) in resurrection after death.(And let a party of believers) one man, two or more so that the punishment is preserved (witness theirpunishment) witness the execution of the punishment.
24|3|(The adulterer) from the people of the Book who admits his crime (shall not marry save an adulteress) fromthe slaves of the people of the Book (or an idolatress) from the slaves of the Arab idolaters, (and theadulteress none shall marry save an adulterer) from the people of the Book (or an idolater) from the Arabidolaters. (All that) marrying the slaves of the people of the Book and the slaves of Arab idolaters (isforbidden unto believers) this verse was revealed about a group among the Companions of the Prophet(pbuh) who wanted to marry some slaves from the people of the Book and Arab idolaters in Medina. Theseslaves were known adulteresses but these prophetic Companions wanted to marry them in order to winthem over. When this verse was revealed they refrained from marrying them.
24|4|(And those who accuse honourable women) of committing adultery (but bring not four witnesses) fourupright, Muslim persons, (scourge them (with)) flog them (eighty stripes) for their slander (and never(afterward) accept their testimony. They indeed are evil-doers) they are sinners because of their slander.
24|5|(Save those who afterward repent) after their slander (and make amends) between themselves and theirLord. ((For such) lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents, (Merciful) He bestows mercy uponwhoever dies repentant. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host.
24|6|(As for those who accuse their wives) of committing adultery (but have no witnesses) for their accusation(except themselves; let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, (swearing) by Allah) other thanWhom there is no god (that he is of those who speak the Truth) about his accusation of his wife;
24|7|(And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him) and on the fifth the man should invoke Allah's curse onhimself (if he is of those who lie) about his wife having committed adultery.
24|8|(And it shall avert) the judge will abstain from applying (the punishment from her) the punishment ofstoning on the accused wife (if she bear witness before Allah four times) if the woman swears four times byAllah with Whom there is no other god (that the thing he) her husband (saith is indeed false) is untrue,
24|9|(And a fifth (time) that the wrath of Allah be upon her) upon the wife (if he) her husband (speaketh truth) istrue about what he says about her.
24|10|(And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you) He would reveal who was lying of thetwo, (and that Allah is Clement) Allah forgives whoever repents, (Wise, (ye had been undone)) He decreedthat this swearing and cursing takes place between the husband and his wife whom he accuses of adultery.This verse was revealed about 'Asim Ibn 'Adiyy al-Ansari who was afflicted with this.
24|11|(Lo! they who spread the slander) those who spread the lie (are a gang among you) this was revealed about'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the hypocrite, and Hassan Ibn Thabit al-Ansari, and Mistah Ibn Uthathah, thecousin of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, and 'Ubadah Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib and Hamnah Bint Jahsh al-Asadiyyah whoslandered 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal. (Deem it not) deem not the slandering of 'A'ishah and Safwan(a bad thing for you) in the Hereafter; (say, it is good for you) in terms of reward. (Unto every man of them)who engaged in slandering 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal (will be paid that which he hath earned ofthe sin) in accordance to his engagement in the slander; (and as for him among them who had the greatershare therein) the one who spread the matter and uttered abominable things concerning this matter, i.e.'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (his will be an awful doom) in this worldly life by imposing the legal punishment on himand in the Hereafter by being cast in hell.
24|12|(Why did not the believers, men and women, when you heard it) i.e. the slander of 'A'ishah and Safwan,(think good of their own folk) think good of 'A'ishah as they would think good of their mothers; (and say: It)their slander (is a manifest untruth) is a manifest lie?
24|13|(Why did they not produce four witnesses) four, upright witnesses to support their claim? (Since theyproduce not witnesses) four witnesses, (they verily are liars in the sight of Allah).
24|14|Then Allah revealed the following about those who did not slander 'A'ishah but talked about the slander:(Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world and the Hereafter an awfuldoom had overtaken you) chastisement would have seized you in this worldly life and in the Hereafter (forthat whereof you murmured) for the slanderous accusation which you repeated.
24|15|(When ye welcomed it with your tongues) when you related the slander to each other, (and uttered withyour mouths that whereof ye had no knowledge) proof or clarification, (ye counted it) i.e. the slander of'A'ishah (a trifle) an insignificant sin. (In the sight of Allah it is very great) in terms of punishment.
24|16|(Wherefore, when ye heard it) i.e. the slander of 'A'ishah and Safwan, (said ye not: It is not for us to speakof this) we are not permitted to speak about this lie. (Glory be to Thee (O Allah); This is awful calumny) thisis a great lie.
24|17|(Allah admonisheth you) Allah warns and prohibits you (that ye repeat not the like thereof ever) to everengage in similar things, (if ye are (in truth) believers) if you are true believers.
24|18|(And He expoundeth unto you His revelations) detailing the commands and prohibitions. (Allah is Knower)He knows what you say, (Wise) regarding the legal punishments He imposes on you.
24|19|(Lo! Those) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (who love that slander should be spread) appear(concerning those who believe) 'A'ishah and Safwan, (theirs will be a painful punishment) by being flogged(in the world and the Hereafter) by being thrown in hell, especially 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy. (Allah knoweth)that 'A'ishah and Safwan did not commit adultery. (Ye know not) this.
24|20|(Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you) unto those who did not slander 'A'ishah andSafwan, (and that Allah is Clement, Merciful, (ye had been undone)) towards the believers.
24|21|Allah then warned the believers from following Satan, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) andin the Qur'an! (Follow not the footsteps of the devil) do not follow Satan's embellishment and whisperings.(Unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil) whoever follows Satan's embellishment andwhisperings, (lo! he commandeth filthiness) evil words and deeds (and wrong) that which is not in theShari'ah or the Sunnah. (Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you) through preservingyou from sins and giving you success, (not one of you would ever have grown pure) no one of you wouldprofess Allah's divine Oneness or become righteous. (But Allah causeth whom He will to grow) but Allahgives success and makes righteous whoever deserves it. (And Allah is Hearer) He hears what you say,(Knower) He knows you and your works.
24|22|Allah then revealed the following about Abu Bakr when he swore that he will not spend on his relatives,Mistah and others, because they talked about the slandering of 'A'ishah: (And let not those who possessdignity) through their spending (and ease) due to their wealth (among you swear not to give to the near ofkin) Mistah was his maternal cousin (and to the needy) beside being his cousin, Mistah was also poor, (andto fugitives for the cause of Allah) and to the Immigrants for the sake of Allah, for Mistah was also anImmigrant. (Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you) do you notwant, O Abu Bakr, that Allah forgive you? (Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) towards the person who repents.When he heard this, Abu Bakr said: "I do indeed, O my Lord!" and so after the revelation of this verse, heshowed kindness to his relatives and helped them financially.
24|23|Allah then revealed the following about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host who slandered 'A'ishah andSafwan: (Lo! as for those who traduce) accusing them of adultery (virtuous) and free, (believing) theybelieve in Allah's divine Oneness (women) i.e. 'A'ishah ((who are) careless) who are chaste and exoneratedfrom adultery, (cursed are they) they should be punished (in the world) by flogging them (and theHereafter) by casting them in the Fire. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy. (Theirs) the referencehere is to 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy and his host (will be an awful doom) more severe than the chastisement theywill be exposed to in this worldly life.
24|24|(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when their tongues and their hands and their feet testifyagainst them) against what 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host said and did (as to what they used to do) inthe life of this world,
24|25|(On that day) the Day of Judgement (Allah will pay them their just due) he will fairly requite them for theirworks, (and they will know that Allah, He is the Manifest Truth) they will know that what Allah said in the lifeof this world is true.
24|26|He also revealed about them: (Vile women) those who are vile in their speech and deeds (are for vile men)they deserve vile men, (and vile men for vile women) they deserve one another. (Good women) goodwomen in their speech and deeds (are for good men) they deserve them, (and good men for good women)they deserve one another; it is also said that this means: good women, i.e. 'A'ishah, are for good men, i.e.the Prophet (pbuh); (such) 'A'ishah and Safwan (are innocent of that which people say) they are innocent ofpeople's slander: (For them is pardon) their sins are pardoned in the life of this world (and a bountifulprovision) in Paradise. He says: when any man or woman are praised, and they deserve such a praise, thenwhatever they are praised with is true. And when a vile man or woman are mentioned with ill, and theydeserve such an ill mention, then they deserve being mentioned in an ill manner.
24|27|Allah then prohibited them from entering in on one another without first asking permission, saying: (O yewho believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Enter not houses other than your own) you are notpermitted to enter houses (without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof.That) announcing your presence and invoking peace (is better for you) and more akin to righteousness,(that ye may be heedful) that you may take admonition and not enter in on each other without permission.
24|28|(And if ye find no one therein) in the houses to give you permission to enter, (still enter not until permissionhath been given) to enter. (And if it be said unto you: Go away again) and if you are told not to enter, (thengo away) and remain not standing at the door of people's houses, (for it is purer for you) for it is better foryou than to remain standing at the doors of people's houses. (Allah knoweth what ye do) of askingpermission and other things.
24|29|Then Allah gave them leave to enter houses which are not theirs-it is here a question of the inns which areusually found in the roads-saying: ((It is) no sin) there is no constraint (for you to enter uninhabited houses)houses which do not have known inhabitants, such as inns and hostels (wherein is comfort for you) whereyou can find some benefit, against cold in the winter and heat in the summer (Allah knoweth what yeproclaim) of asking permission and invoking greetings of peace (and what ye hide) of giving a response andpermission.
24|30|Allah then commanded them to protect their gaze and chastity, saying: (Tell the believing men) OMuhammad (to lower their gaze) from that which is unlawful (and be modest) and also refrain from unlawfulsexual intercourse. (That) protecting their gaze and chastity (is purer for them) is better and more akin torighteousness as far as they are concerned. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) of good and evil.
24|31|(And tell the believing women) O Muhammad (to lower their gaze) from men, that which is unlawful as faras men are concerned (and be modest) and be chaste, (and to display of their adornment) their braceletsand ornamented belts (only that which is apparent) of their clothes, (and to draw their veils over theirbosoms) and they should tie that; and then Allah mentioned the adornment again, and said: (and not toreveal their adornment) their bracelets and ornamented belts and other things (save to their own husbandsor fathers) blood fathers or stepfathers (or husbands fathers, or their sons) real sons or milk sons (or theirhusbands' sons) from other women, (or their brothers) their milk brothers or blood brothers (or theirbrothers' sons) their real sons or stepsons (or sisters sons) their real sons or milk sons, (or their women) i.e.Muslim women who belong to their own religion, because it is unlawful for Jewish, Christian or Magianwomen to see them without their clothes on, (or their slaves) female slaves, not male slaves, (or maleattendants who lack vigour) or male attendants who belong to their husbands who have no desire forwomen: i.e. eunuchs and elderly men, (or children who know naught of women's nakedness) children whoare too young to sleep with women and do not understand what goes on between men and women, such asthese can see the adornment of women without there being any doubt. (And let them not stamp their feet)their anklets (so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment) so that strange men know what they hideof their adornment. (And turn unto Allah together) and repent of all sins whether great or small, (Obelievers, in order that ye may succeed) in order that you escape Allah's wrath and chastisement.
24|32|Then Allah guided them to marry their boys and girls, brothers and sisters, who do not have spouses,saying: (And marry such of you as are solitary) your daughters and sisters; and it is said that this means:your children and brothers and sisters who are still unmarried (and the pious of your slaves and maidservants) and also get your pious slave men and women married. (If they) i.e. those who are free (be poor;Allah will enrich them of His bounty) of His provision. (Allah is of ample means) He provides for both thosewho are free as well as for the slaves, (Aware) and He is Aware of the provision of all of them.
24|33|(And let those who cannot find a match) those who are unable to marry (keep chaste till Allah give themindependence by His grace) until Allah gives them sufficiency from His provision. This was revealed aboutHuwaytib Ibn 'Abd al-'Uzza who refused to agree to give one of his slaves a chance to buy out his freedom.(And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation)) to buy out their freedom, (write it for them ifye are aware of aught of good in them) if you know they are righteous and keep their promise, (and bestowupon them) upon all people (of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you) so that they canmake an agreement for their emancipation; it is also said that here the master is encouraged to forgive athird of what has been agreed upon with his slave who wants to buy out his freedom. Then the followingwas revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host because they used to force their female slaves tocommit adultery in order to earn money from them and have more slaves as result of the children they boreas a consequence, and so Allah forbade them from doing this and made such an act forbidden: (Force notyour slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world) from what they earn fromworking as prostitutes and also from the children they give birth to, (if they would preserve their chastity) ifthey want to remain chaste. (And if one force them) and if one force these slave girl to commit adultery,(then (unto them), after their compulsion) and repentance, (Lo! Allah will be Forgiving) He forgives them,(Merciful) and He will show mercy towards them after they die.
24|34|(And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain) He says: We have sent Gabriel to yourprophets with revelations that make plain the lawful and the unlawful, the commands and the prohibitions ofadultery and indecencies, (and the example of those who passed away before you) the trait of those whopassed away from among the believers and disbelievers. (An admonition) a prohibition (unto those whoward off (evil)) adultery and indecencies.
24|35|Allah then mentioned the honour and blessings that He had bestowed upon the believers, saying: (Allah isthe Light of the heavens and the earth) He is the guide of the dwellers of the heaves and earth. Guidancefrom Allah is of two types: clarification and making things known; it is also said that the verse means: Allahis the embellisher of the heavens by means of the stars and the embellisher of the earth by means of plantsand water; it is also said that this means: Allah enlightens the hearts of the believers among the dwellers ofthe heavens and the earth. (The similitude of His light) the light of the believers; it is also said that thismeans: the light of Allah in the heart of the believer (is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass)made of gems. (The glass is as it were a shining star) one of the following five planets: Mercury, Jupiter,Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these planets are luminous. ((This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree) fromthe oil of a blessed tree, (an olive neither of the East nor of the West) in an open space, not touched by theshade of the East nor by the shade of the West; it is also said that this means: in a location which isuntouched by the sun when it rises and when it sets, (whose oil) the oil of the tree (would almost glow forth(of itself)) from behind its rind (though no fire touched it. Light upon light) the lamp emits light and theglass emits light and the oil emits light, (Allah guideth unto His light) Allah honours with knowledge; it is alsosaid that this means: Allah honours with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it; it is also said thatthe verse means: the likeness of the light of Muhammad in the loins of his forefathers is like this, up toAllah's saying (... kindled from a blessed tree). He says: the light of Muhammad in Abraham was an uprightreligion (olive tree), and Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian (neither of the East nor of the West), theworks of Abraham would almost glow forth in the loins of his forefathers like this (would almost glow forth(of itself)), up until Allah's saying (kindled from a blessed tree) He says: as if it is the light of Muhammad(pbuh) and if Abraham was not a prophet, he would still have this light (though no fire touched it); it is alsosaid that the latter passage means: Had Allah not honoured Abraham, he would not have had this light; it isalso said: if Allah had not honoured His believing servant with this light, he would not have had it. (And Allahspeaketh to mankind in allegories) in this way does Allah show to people the trait of knowledge, (for Allah isknower of all things) regarding the honour He bestows upon His servants. Allah struck this similitude ofknowledge and clarified its benefit and its praiseworthiness in order that they give thanks to it. Allah sayshere that just as one uses a lamp to find his way in the dark, so is the light of knowledge used for one'sguidance; and just as one uses the stars and planets to find one's way in the darkness of the seas and land,one also uses the light of knowledge for guidance in the darkness of disbelief and idolatry; and just as the oilof a lamp is taken from the blessed olive tree, so too is knowledge from Allah, Exalted is He, for His servant;and just as the olive tree is neither from the East nor from the West, so too is the believer an uprightMuslim, neither Jew nor Christian; and just as the oil of the olive tree would almost glow forth of itself evenwhen no fire touches it, so too the faith of the believer is praiseworthy even when there are no virtuousworks to accompany it; and just as the niche and the glass and the lamp are light upon light, so too isknowledge light, and the heart of the believer is light and his chest is light and his incoming is light and hisoutgoing is light: light upon light; and Allah honours with this light whomever He wills. Such is Allah'sdescription of knowledge.
24|36|((This lamp is found) in houses) these lamps are hung in houses (which Allah hath allowed) which Allah hascommanded (to be exalted) to be built; the reference here is to mosques (and that His Name) His divineOneness (shall be remembered therein) in the mosques. (Therein) in the mosques (do offer praise to Him)pray to Him (at morn) the Fajr prayer (and evening) the prayers of Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Isha'.
24|37|(Men whom neither merchandise) which may bring them profit (nor) hand to hand (sale beguileth)preoccupies (from remembrance of Allah) from the obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: fromperforming the five daily prayers (and constancy in prayer) the performance of the five daily prayers withtheir required ritual ablution, bowings, prostrations and that which is enjoined in their prescribed times (andpaying) from their wealth (to the poor their due; who fear a day) who fear the chastisement of the Day ofJudgement (when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned) changing from state to state, such that sometimesthey are aware and sometimes they are not;
24|38|(That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did) in the life of this world, (and increase rewardfor them of His bounty) for each one nine rewards. (Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will) Hegives to whom He will without measure, or count or ever reminding them of what He gives them as afavour.
24|39|(As for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (their deeds) the similitude of theirworks in the Hereafter (are as a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one supposeth it to be water) from far (tillhe cometh unto it and findeth it naught) he finds that it is not water; similarly, the disbeliever will not findany reward for his works in the Hereafter, (and finds, in the place thereof, Allah) and he finds with Allah thepunishment for the sins he committed; it is also said that this means: and finds Allah ready to chastise him,(Who payeth him his due) Who inflict on him his punishment; (and Allah is swift at reckoning) Allah is severein His punishment; it is also said that this means: when Allah takes people to task His reckoning is swift.
24|40|(Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea) He says: the similitude of denial in the heart of the disbeliever islike darkness in the depth of a very deep sea. (There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave) anotherwave, (above which is a cloud) likewise, the heart of the disbeliever, like the denial in his heart, is similar tothe darkness of the bottom of the sea; and his heart is like a deep sea; and his chest is like a huge wave,and his works are like a useless cloud, because Allah sealed the disbelievers hearts and hearings and sights.(Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it) from intense darkness;likewise, the disbeliever does not see the Truth and guidance because of the intense darkness of his heart.(And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light) knowledge in this worldly life, (for him there is no light) hehas no knowledge in the Hereafter; it is also said that this means: the one whom Allah has not honouredwith faith in the life of this world, Allah will not honour with faith in the Hereafter.
24|41|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that Allah, He it is Whom allwho are in the heavens) of angels (and the earth) of believers (praise) pray to; (and the birds) they praiseHim (in their flight) spreading their wings? (Of each) one of them (He knoweth verily the worship) whoprays to Him (and the praise) who praises His hymn; it is also said that this means: He knows the prayer ofthe one who prays to Him and the praises of the one who praises Him; (and Allah is Aware of what they do)of good or evil.
24|42|(And Unto Allah belongeth the sovereignty) the storehouses (of the heavens) rain (and the earth)vegetation, (and unto Allah is the journeying) the return after death.
24|43|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an about (how Allah wafteth)drives about (the clouds, then gatherth them) then brings the clouds together, (then maketh them layers,and thou seest the rain come forth from between them) from between the clouds; (He sendeth down fromthe heaven mountains wherein is hail) He says: He sends down hail from mountains in heaven, (and smiteththerewith) and with hail He punishes (whom He will, and averteth it) and averts its punishment (from whomHe will. The flashing of His lightning) the light emanating from lightning in the clouds (all but snatchethaway the sight) from the intensity of its light.
24|44|(Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night) He takes away the night and brings in its stead theday and takes away the day and brings in its stead the night; this is what is meant by their revolution. (Lo!Herein) in the alternation of day and night which I have mentioned (is indeed a lesson) a sign (for thosewho see) in relation to matters of religion; it is also said that this means: those who see with their eyes.
24|45|(Allah hath created every animal) on the face of the earth (of water) from the water of the male and female.(Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon its belly) like the snake and similar animals (and (a kind) that goethupon two legs) like human beings and those that are similar to them (and (a kind) that goeth upon four)beasts. (Allah createth what He will) as He wills. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) whether this concernscreation or other things.
24|46|(Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them) He says: We sent Gabriel with revelationsexpositing the commands and prohibitions. (Allah guideth) to His religion (whom He will) and honourswhoever deserves it (unto a straight path) an established religion with which He is pleased: i.e. Islam.
24|47|Allah then revealed the following about the folk of 'Uthman who told the latter: "do not go to the Prophet(pbuh) in order to settle your dispute with 'Ali regarding a piece of land, because He will take 'Ali's side", and'Uthman rebuked them for saying this: (And they say) i.e. the people of 'Uthman: (We believe in Allah andthe messenger) we are sincere in our belief in Allah and the Messenger, (and we obey) that with which wehave been commanded; (then after that) after saying this about obeying Allah (a faction of them) of thepeople of 'Uthman (turn away. Such are not believers) who are sincere in their faith.
24|48|(And when they appeal unto Allah) when they are called to the Book of Allah (and His messenger to judgebetween them) by Allah's Book, (lo! a faction of them are averse) from the Book of Allah and the judgementof the Messenger;
24|49|(But if right had been with them) with the people of 'Uthman (they would have come unto him) to theProphet (pbuh) (willingly) in haste and obediently.
24|50|(Is there in their hearts a disease) doubt and hypocrisy, (or have they doubts) concerning Allah and HisMessenger, (or fear they lest Allah and His messenger should wrong them in judgement? Nay, but such areevil-doers) who harm themselves and are further hypocrites.
24|51|Allah then mentioned what the sincere believers say, saying: (The saying of (all true) believers) such as'Uthman who said to 'Ali: "rather, I will come with you to the Prophet (pbuh) and I will accept his judgementwhatever it is", and so Allah praised him for saying so, (when they appeal unto Allah) when they are calledto the Book of Allah (and His messenger) and to the wont of His Messenger (to judge) for the Prophet tojudge (between them) by Allah's Book (is only that they say: We hear and we obey) what we have beencommanded with. (And such are the successful) such are the ones, i.e. 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan, who will escapeAllah's wrath and chastisement.
24|52|And Allah also revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan when he said: "O Messenger of Allah! If you so wish, I willgive up all my wealth" and so Allah said: (He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger) in His judgement, (andfeareth Allah) in that which has passed, (and keepeth duty (unto Him)) in the future: (such indeed are thevictorious) they have gained Paradise and are saved from the Fire.
24|53|(They swear by Allah solemnly) 'Uthman swore solemnly by Allah (that, if thou order them, they will goforth) he will give up all his wealth. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Swear not; known obedience (is better))if you do so it is a known obedience, but you should obey Allah in relation to that which you have beencommanded. (Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do) of good or evil.
24|54|(Say) O Muhammad, to 'Uthman: (Obey Allah) regarding the obligations (and obey the messenger) in hiswont and judgement. (But if you turn away) but if they turn away from obeying both, (then (it is) for him (todo) only that wherewith he hath been charged) what he has been commanded to convey, (and for you (todo) only that wherewith you have been charged) what you have been commanded to respond. (If ye obeyhim) if you obey Allah in that which He commands you, (ye will go aright) and avoid error. (But themessenger hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly) from Allah.
24|55|(Allah hath promised such of you) O Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (as believe and do good works)between themselves and their Lord (that He will surely make them to succeed (the present rulers) in theearth (to succeed others)) some of them in succession to others (even as He caused those who were beforethem) among the Children of Israel: Joshua ben Nun, Caleb ben Jephunneh; it is also said that this means:We shall make them dwell in the land of Mecca as We made those before them, among the Children ofIsrael, dwell in their land after the destruction of their enemy; (and that He will surely establish for them) Hewill make triumph (their religion which He hath approved for them) and has chosen for them, (and will givethem in exchange) of Mecca (safety) following the destruction of their enemy (after their fear) of the enemy.(They serve Me) in order that they worship Me in Mecca. (They ascribe no thing) no idol (as partner untoMe. Those who disbelieve henceforth) after victory and change of fortune, (they are the miscreants) thedisobedient.
24|56|(Establish worship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey themessenger) in his judgement, (that haply ye may find mercy) and not be punished.
24|57|(Think not) O Muhammad (that the disbelievers) of Mecca (can escape) from Allah's punishment (in theland. Fire) in the Hereafter (will be their home) their abode, (a hapless journey's end) to which they willreturn with the satans! This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his host.
24|58|Then the following was revealed when 'Umar said: "I wish that Allah forbids our children and servants fromentering in on us except with permission at three times when we are likely to be exposed": (O ye whobelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Let your slaves) young slaves, (and those of you whohave not come to puberty) among those who are not slaves, (ask leave of you) to enter in on you (at threetimes: Before the prayer of dawn) from the time of dawn until the beginning of Fajr prayer, (and when yelay aside your raiment for the heat of noon) for the time of the siesta until the prayer of Zuhr, (and after theprayer of night) and after the 'Isha' prayer to the break of dawn. (Three times of privacy for you). ThenAllah gave them dispensation to enter without permission, saying: (It is no sin for them) for the children oryoung slaves, excepting from this older slaves, (or for you) for the masters of the house (at other times)other than those three times of privacy, (when some of you go round) to serve (attendant upon others) youand them can enter in on each other without permission. As for older children and older slaves they have toask permission at all times before entering in on their parents or masters. (Thus Allah maketh clear therevelations for you) He explains the commands and prohibitions just as He explained this. (Allah is Knower)He knows what is good for you, (Wise) He decreed that young children and slaves ask permission in thosethree times of privacy.
24|59|Allah then mentioned only older children and slaves, saying: (And when the children among you come topuberty) whether they are your own children or your slaves (then let them ask leave) at all times (even asthose before them) of their brothers who were mentioned before (used to ask it. Thus Allah maketh clearHis revelations) His commands and prohibitions as He explained this (for you. Allah is knower) He knowswhat is good for you, (Wise) He decreed that older people must ask permission at all times.
24|60|(As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage) and do not need to get married, (it is nosin for them) for such women (if they discard their (outer) clothing) in front of strange people (in such a wayas not to show adornment) without adorning themselves or showing their adornment to strangers. (But torefrain) to keep their outer garment on (is better for them) than discarding it. (Allah is Hearer) He hearswhat they say, (Knower) He knows their deeds.
24|61|Allah then revealed the following when the believers found it hard to eat with each other for fear oftransgressing, because of Allah's saying (And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity), and soAllah gave them dispensation to eat with each other saying: (No blame is there upon the blind) He says:there is no sin for the one who eats with the blind (nor any blame upon the lame) and there is no sin for theone who eats with the lame (nor any blame upon the sick) and there is no sin for the one who eats with thesick (nor on yourselves) a sin (if ye eat from your houses) from the houses of your children without askingpermission but with moderation, (or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or thehouses of your brothers) whether blood brothers, half brothers or milk brothers, (or the houses of yoursisters) whether blood sisters, half sisters or milk sisters, (or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or thehouses of your fathers' sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the houses of your mothers'sisters, or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys) from that of which you hold the stores of what you have ofwealth, i.e. male and female slaves, (or (from the house) of a friend) this was revealed about Malik Ibn Zaydand al-Harth Ibn 'Ammar who were friends. (No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together) inmoderation (or apart) and in this are included the blind, the lame, the sick and other categories of people.(But when ye enter houses) i.e. your houses or mosques and find no one there, (salute one another) say:"peace be upon us from our Lord" (with a greeting from Allah) as an honour from Allah to you, (blessed)with reward (and sweet) with forgiveness. (Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations) He exposits thecommands and prohibitions just as He exposited this (for you, that haply ye may understand) what you havebeen commanded with.
24|62|(They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger) privately and in the open (and,when they are with him) with the Prophet (pbuh) (on some common errand) on Friday or in a militaryexpedition, (go not away) from the mosque or from the military expedition (until they have asked leave ofhim) ask permission from the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! those who ask leave of thee) O Muhammad to returnfrom the battle of Tabuk; this refers to 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who asked the Prophet (pbuh) to give himleave to return to Medina because of an ailment which visited him, (those are they who believe in Allah andHis messenger) in private and openly. (So, if they ask thy leave) so if sincere believers ask you, OMuhammad, (for some affair of theirs) for a need of theirs, (give leave to whom thou wilt of them) of thesincere believers, (and ask for them forgiveness of Allah) regarding that for which they have gone. (Lo! Allahis Forgiving) He forgives the one who repents, (Merciful) He shows mercy towards the one who diesrepentant.
24|63|(Make not the calling of the messenger among you) i.e. do not call the Prophet (pbuh) by his name saying:O Muhammad, (as your calling one of another) by name. You should rather respect him, show deferencetowards him and honour him by saying: "O Prophet of Allah", "O Messenger of Allah", "O Abu'l-Qasim":(Allah knoweth those of you who steal away) from the mosque, (hiding themselves) the hypocrites used toleave the mosque without permission when no one could see them. (And let those who conspire to evadeorders) the orders of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh); it is also said that this means: the orders of Allah(beware lest grief) a calamity (or painful punishment) beating (befall them.

(He knowethyour condition) whether it is disbelief or faith, trueness or denial, sincerity or hypocrisy, uprightness orcrookedness, etc. (And (He knoweth) the Day when they are returned unto Him) unto Allah on the Day ofJudgement (so that He may inform them of what they did) in this worldly life. (Allah is Knower of all things)concerning their works'.
25|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Blessed is): '(Blessed is) He says: He is the Possessor of grace; it is also said that this means: He isexalted and transcendent above and exonerated from having a son or partner (He Who hath revealed untoHis slave) Muhammad (pbuh) (the Criterion (of right and wrong)) He Who sent Gabriel with the Qur'an,(that he) Muhammad (pbuh) (may be a warner) a Messenger warning by the Qur'an (to the peoples) thejinn and human beings.
25|2|(He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty) the storehouses (of the heavens) rain (and the earth)vegetation. (He hath chosen no son) as claimed by the Jews and Christians (nor hath He any partner in thesovereignty) as claimed by the Arab idolaters. (He hath created everything) that which they worship andthat which they do not worship (and hath meted out for it a measure) their lifespan, provision and works areall in a specific measure; it is also said that this means: He decreed for each male a female.
25|3|(Yet they) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Jahl and his host (choose) to worship (beside Him) beside Allah(other gods who create naught) who are unable to create anything (but are themselves created) while theirdeities, i.e. idols, are created and carved, (and possess) the idols (not hurt) driving away harm (nor profit)nor obtaining profit (for themselves) or for anyone else, (and possess not death) they have no ability todiminish one's life (nor life) nor to increase one's life; it is also said that this means: they are unable tocreate a sperm drop nor to place therein the spirit, (nor power to raise the dead) after they die.
25|4|(Those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: This) Qur'an (is naught but a lie that he hathinvented) that Muhammad (pbuh) has invented, (and other folk) Jabr, Yasar and Fukayhah al-Rumi (havehelped him with it) to invent it, (so that they have produced a slander and a lie.
25|5|And they) al-Nadr Ibn al-Harth and his host (say: Fables of the men of old) this Qur'an is nothing but thetales and lies of the people of old (which he hath had written down) which Muhammad (pbuh) copied fromJabr and Yasar (so that they are dictated to him) to Muhammad (pbuh) (morn and evening) in the morningand the evening.
25|6|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (He Who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the earth has revealed it)i.e. He sent Gabriel with the Qur'an. (Lo! He ever is Forgiving) He forgives those who repent among them,(Merciful) He shows mercy towards those who die in a state of repentance.
25|7|(And they say) Abu Jahl and his host, al-Nadr and his host, and Umayyah Ibn Khalaf and his host say: (Whataileth this messenger (of Allah) that he eateth food) like we do (and walketh in the markets) and goes to themarkets and walks there as we do? (Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner with him) tohelp and inform him of the evil things which are planned against him.
25|8|(Or (why is not) a treasure thrown down unto him) for him to use, (or why hath he not a Paradise) a garden(from whence to eat) and be full? (And the evil-doers) the idolaters: Abu Jahl, al-Nadr and Umayyah andtheir hosts (say: Ye are but following a man) Muhammad (bewitched) who is possessed and mad.
25|9|(See how they coin similitudes for thee) see how they explain things to you and call you names: magician,fortune teller, liar, poet, and madman; it is also said that this means: see how they liken you to a bewitchedperson, (so that they are all astray) their scheming went amiss and they fell in error (and cannot find aroad) they cannot find a way out of what they said about you, nor do they have any proof about what theysay about you!
25|10|(Blessed is He) He says: Exalted is He (Who, if He will) and He does will, (will assign you better than (all)that) than all what they said. (Gardens) in the Hereafter (underneath which) beneath its trees andhabitations (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, and will assign you mansions) and He has indeedassigned you in Paradise mansions of gold and silver which are better for you than that which they say; andit is also said that this means: if Allah wills, he will assign to you in this worldly life that which they requestedof you: mansions and gardens, i.e. He will make you conquer towers and townships, in the East and theWest, in spite of the disbelievers.
25|11|(Nay, but they deny the Hour) they deny the coming of the Hour, (and for those who deny (the coming of)the Hour We have prepared a Flame) the Fire and its fuel.
25|12|(When it) the Fire (seeth them from afar) from a distance of 500 years, (they bear the cracking) theexasperation which is akin to that of human beings (and the roar) similar to the braying of a donkey(thereof) coming from the Fire.
25|13|(And when they are flung into a narrow place) the narrowness of an arrowhead (thereof) in the Fire,(chained together) chained with the satans, (they pray for destruction there) at that point, in despair theypray.
25|14|Allah will say to them: (Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions) for what hasbefallen you!
25|15|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca, Abu Jahl and his host: (Is that (doom)) are destruction and firewhich I mentioned to you (better or the Garden of Immortality) for Muhammad and his Companions (whichis promised unto those who ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry and indecencies? (It) the Garden ofImmortality (will be their reward and journey's end) in the Hereafter.
25|16|(Therein) in the Garden (abiding) never to die or come out, (they have all that they desire) and wish. (It isfor thy Lord a promise that must be fulfilled) they asked Him and He gave them.
25|17|(And on the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when He will assemble them) i.e. those who worship idols(and that which they worship instead of Allah) of idols (and will say) Allah will say to the idols; and it is said:He will say to the angels: (Was it ye who misled these my slaves) from My obedience and commanded themto worship you (or did they (themselves) wander from the way) and worshipped you out of their ownwhims?
25|18|(They) the idols (will say: Be Thou glorified) they exonerated Him! (It was not for us) we had no right (tochoose) to worship (any protecting friends beside Thee) as lords; it is also said that this means: they said,i.e. the angels, glory be to You! We were not permitted to worship any lords besides You, so how could wehave command them to worship us? (but Thou didst give them and their fathers) before them (ease) Yougave them a reprieve in their state of disbelief (till they forgot the warning) until they shunned professingYour divine Oneness and refrained from worshipping you (and became lost folk) doomed for destruction andwhose hearts became evil.
25|19|(Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say, then ye) i.e. the disbelievers (can neither avert) avertthe angels, and it is said this means: avert the idols from testifying against them or avert the chastisementfrom themselves (nor obtain help) backup. (And whoso among you doeth wrong) whoever among you, OMuslims, disbelieves; it is also said that this means: whosever of you, O disbelievers, remains firm in hisdisbelief, (We shall make him taste great torment) in the Fire.
25|20|(We never sent before you) O Muhammad (any messengers but lo! they ate food) as you do; this is inresponse to the disbelievers of Mecca who said: (What ails this messenger (of Allah) that he eats food), (andwalked in the markets) just as you walk. (And We have appointed some of you a test) a trial (for others) Wetest the pure Arab with the client, and the noble by birth with the lowly and the rich with the poor; Allah saidto Abu Jahl and his host: (Will ye be steadfast) with the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) Salman and hisfellow believers, such that you become with them, in relation to Religion and other matters, equal and thatyou sit together with them? (And thy Lord is ever Seer) that they will not be steadfast regarding this. It isalso said that this means: will you be steadfast, O Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) in the face of theirharm until I grant you the reward of the steadfast, and your Lord sees who believes among you and whodoes not?
25|21|(And those who look not for a meeting with Us) those who do not believe in resurrection after death, i.e.Abu Jahl and his host (say: Why are angels not sent down unto us) to inform us that Allah sent you to us(and (why) do we not see our Lord) to ask Him about you? (Assuredly they think too highly of themselves)to simply believe; it is also said that this means: they think too highly of themselves when they ask to seeAllah, (and are scornful with great pride) refusing to believe; it is also said that they dared to ask for atremendous thing when they asked for the angels to come to them.
25|22|(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when they behold the angels) at the moment of death, (onthat day there will be no good tidings) the angels will say to them: there is no good tidings, i.e. there is noParadise (for the guilty) for the idolaters; (and they will cry) i.e. the angels will cry: (A forbidding ban) theglad tiding of Paradise is forbidden for the disbelievers; and it is also said that this means: the disbelieverswill say upon seeing the angels: let a great distance be between you and us!
25|23|(And We shall turn unto the work they did) the good work they did in the life of this world (and make it) inthe Hereafter (scattered motes) like scattered dust in the hooves of beasts; it is also said that this means:like tiny particles of dust which can be seen when, from a hole, light enters into a dark place, but theseparticles cannot be touched even though one can see them.
25|24|(Those who have earned the Garden) Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions (on that day) the Day ofJudgement (will be better in their home) abode (and happier in their place of noonday rest) better andhappier than the homes and places of Abu Jahl and their hosts;
25|25|(A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder) for the descent of Allah and this descent iswithout any modality (bi-la kayf) (and the angels will be sent down, a grand descent) one after another.
25|26|(The Sovereignty) judgement (on that day will be the True (Sovereignty)) justice (belonging to theBeneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers) the hardship of that Day is very severe on them.
25|27|(On the day when the wrong-doer) the disbeliever, i.e. 'Uqbah Ibn Ma'it (gnaweth his hands) his fingers, (hewill say: Ah, would that I had chosen a way together with the messenger (of Allah)) would that I hadchosen, and were upright in following the religion of the Prophet!
25|28|(Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such an one) Ubayy Ibn Khalaf (for friend) following hisreligion!
25|29|(He verily led me astray from the Reminder) from Allah's divine Oneness and obedience (after it had reachedme) after Muhammad (pbuh) reached me with Allah's divine Oneness. (Satan was ever man's deserter in thehour of need) he lets him down at the time of need.
25|30|(And the messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of noaccount) they speak ill of it, they do not believe in it and do not act upon its teachings.
25|31|(Even so) just as We have appointed Abu Jahl as your enemy (have We appointed unto every Prophet)before you (an opponent from among the guilty) from the idolaters of his people; (but Allah sufficeth for aGuide) a Preserver (and Helper) and Defender against what they plot against you.
25|32|(And those who disbelieve) Abu Jahl and his host (say: Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at once)just like the Torah was revealed all at once to Moses, and the Gospel to Jesus and the Psalms to David? ((Itis revealed) thus) He says: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in instalments (that We may strengthenthy heart therewith) that We may gladden your heart and preserve your heart; (and We have arranged it inright order) We exposited it by detailing the commands and prohibitions; it is also said that this means: Wehave sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in instalments verse after verse.
25|33|(And they bring thee) O Muhammad (no similitude) no description, proof or explanation (but We bring theethe Truth) with a description, exposition and proof that contradict their proof (and better (than theirsimilitude) as argument) and better explanation and proof than their proof.
25|34|(Those who will be gathered) will be dragged (on their faces unto hell) i.e. Abu Jahl and his host: (such areworse in plight) they have a worse abode in the Hereafter and worse works in this worldly life (and furtherfrom the right road) from the Truth and guidance.
25|35|(We verify gave Moses the Scripture) the Torah (and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman) ashelper.
25|36|(Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations) those who disbelieved in Ournine signs, i.e. Pharaoh and his people, the Copts. (Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction) bydrowning them.
25|37|(And Noah's folk) and We destroyed the people of Noah, (when they denied the messengers) i.e. Noah andthe rest of messengers, (We drowned them) by means of the flood (and made of them a portent formankind) We made them an admonition for other people so that they do not follow their example. (We haveprepared a painful doom) in the Fire (for evil-doers) for the idolaters, the idolaters of Mecca.
25|38|(And (the tribes of) 'Aad) and We destroyed the people of Hud (and Thamud) the people of Salih, (and thedwellers in Ar-Rass) the people of Shu'ayb, (and many generations in between) We destroyed them all, eventhough We have not mentioned them by name.
25|39|(Each (of them) We warned by examples) We explained to each generation the chastisement We inflictedupon the generations before them, but still they did not believe, (and each (of them) We brought to utterruin) one after the other.
25|40|(And indeed they) the people of Mecca (have passed by the township) the town of Lot (whereon was rainedthe fatal rain) a rain of stones. (Can it be that they have not seen it) have they not seen what was done to itand to its people, and thus refrain from disbelieving in you and in what you say? (Nay, but they hope for noresurrection) they do not fear resurrection after death.
25|41|(And when they) the disbelievers of Mecca (see thee (O Muhammad) they treat thee only as a jest) theyonly speak to you in jest and derision ((saying): Is this he whom Allah sendeth as a messenger) to us?
25|42|(He would have led us far away from our gods) from the worship of our deities (if we had not been staunchto them) if we had not been staunch in worshipping them. (They will know) this is a threat to them fromAllah, (when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the road) as to Religion and proof.
25|43|(Hast thou) O Muhammad (seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust) who worshipped his god, i.e. al-Nadr and his host, out of the whim of his ego? (Wouldst thou) O Muhammad (then be guardian over him) aprotector against going out for such corruption? But this was abrogated by the verse of jihad; it is also saidthat this means: would you be their protector from chastisement?
25|44|(Or deemest thou) O Muhammad (that most of them hear) the Truth (or understand) such Truth when theylisten to your words? (They are) in relation to understanding the Truth (but as the cattle) which knownothing but eating and drinking; they are with regard to the Truth like this, (nay, but they are farther astray)from proof and Religion! Because the cattle have no ability to understand proofs.
25|45|(Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade) after sunrise and before sunset, from the East tothe West. (And if He willed He could have made it) i.e. the shade (still) with no sun, (then We have madethe sun its) the shade's (pilot) wherever one finds the sun one expects to find the shade before that; it isalso said that this means: a guide which comes after it;
25|46|(Then We withdraw it) i.e. the shade (unto Us, a gradual withdrawal) a slight-or as it is said: hidden-withdrawal?
25|47|(And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you) which covers everything, (and sleep repose) for yourbodies, (and maketh day a resurrection) a pursuit for your livelihood.
25|48|(And He it is Who sendeth the winds, glad tidings heralding His mercy) rain, (and We send down purifyingwater from the sky) water which purifies and cannot be purified.

25|50|And verily We have repeated it) the rain (among them) year after year (that they may remember) that theymay take heed, (but most of mankind begrudge aught save in gratitude) they refused and stayed firm iningratitude towards Allah and His blessings.
25|51|(If We willed, We could raise up) We could have sent (a warner) a warning messenger (in every village) tothe people of every village. Instead, We have sent you to all mankind as a Messenger so that reward andhonour will be all yours.
25|52|(So obey not the disbelievers) Abu Jahl and his host regarding hat which they ask of you, (but strive againstthem herewith) by means of the Qur'an (with a great endeavour) by the sword.
25|53|(And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas (though they meet); one palatable, sweet, andthe other saltish, bitter; and hath set a bar) a barrier between the sweet and the salty (and a forbidding banbetween them) preventing either one from transgressing against the other, such as to make the taste ofeither of them change.

(The disbeliever) Abu Jahl (was ever a partisan)rebellious (against his Lord) it is also that this means: he is always a helper, through his disbelief, to thedisbelievers against his Lord.
25|56|(And We have sent thee) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca (only as a bearer of good tidings) Paradise(and a warner) from the Fire.
25|57|(Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (I ask of you no reward) no payment or provision (for this) forprofessing Allah's divine Oneness and for the Qur'an, (save that whoso will may choose a way unto his Lord)through faith; it is also said that this means: save for the one who desires to profess Allah's divine Onenessand by means of this profession tread a way back to his Lord whereby he will find his reward.
25|58|(And trust thou) O Muhammad (in the Living One Who dieth not) and do not trust in those living who diesuch as Abu Talib or Khadijah, nor trust yet in the dead who have no movement, (and hymn His praise) andpray by His command.

26|3|(It may be that thou tormentest thyself) it may be that you kill yourself with grief over them (because theybelieve not) because the Quraysh do not want to become believers. This is because he was very keen forthem to become believers.

26|21|(Then I fled from you when I feared you) when I feared that you would kill me, (and my Lord vouchsafedme a command) understanding, knowledge and prophethood (and appointed me (of the number) of thosesent (by Him)) He made me a Messenger to you and to your people.

26|227|(Save those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, like Hassan Ibn Thabit and his fellowbelieving poets (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (and remember Allah much) in theirpoetry, (and vindicate themselves) through Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions by answering back thedisbelievers (after they have been wronged) after being satirized by the disbelievers. (Those who do wrong)those who satirized the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions (will come to know by what a (great) reversethey will be overturned!) what kind of destination they will return to in the Hereafter, i.e. the Fire, if they donot believe. And Allah knows best the secrets of His Book'.
27|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Ta. Sin.): '(Ta. Sin.) He says: the (Ta) stands for His might (tawluh) and the (Sin) stands for Hismajesty (sana'uh); it is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore. (These are revelations of the Qur'anand a Scripture that maketh plain) this surah consists of verses of the Qur'an and it is a Book that makesplain the lawful and the unlawful;
27|2|(A guidance) from error (and good tidings) that they will gain Paradise (for believers) who are true in theirfaith.
27|3|Allah then showed the attributes of these true believers, saying: (Who establish worship) those whocomplete the five daily prayers along with their necessary ritual ablution, bowing, prostrating and all thatwhich is obligated in their due times (and pay the poor-due) from their wealth (and are sure of) they believein (the Hereafter) resurrection after death, Paradise and hell.
27|4|(Lo! as for those who believe not in the Hereafter) those who do not believe in resurrection after death: AbuJahl and his host, (We have made their works fair-seeming unto them) in their state of disbelief (so thatthey are all astray) so they proceed blindly, unable to see.
27|5|(Those) who have this attribute (are they for whom is the worst of punishment) a severe chastisement inthe Fire, (and in the Hereafter) on the Day of Judgement (they will be the greatest losers) they will looseParadise and enter the Fire.
27|6|(Lo! as for thee) O Muhammad, (thou verily receivest the Qur'an) He says: Gabriel comes down to you withthe Qur'an (from the presence of One Wise) in His command and judgement, (Aware) of His created beings.
27|7|((Remember) when Moses said unto his household) when he became unsure about the way: (Lo! I spy afaroff a fire) on the left side of the road; stay here (I will bring you tidings thence) news about the right way totake, (or bring to you a borrowed flame that ye may warm yourselves) because this happened in a coldwinter.
27|8|(But when he reached it, he was called, saying: Blessed is whosoever is in the Fire) blessed is the Fire (andwhosoever is round about it) of angels! This is the reading of Ubayy and 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud; it is also saidthat this means: blessed is He Who lightened this light; and it also said that this means: blessed is he who isseeking, i.e. Moses and whoever is around him of angels, (And glorified be Allah) He exonerated Himself,(the Lord of the Worlds!) the Master of the jinn and human beings.
27|9|(O Moses! Lo! it is I) Who is calling you, (Allah, the Mighty) in retribution against those who do not believein Me, (the Wise) in My command and judgement, I command that none should be worshipped besides Me.
27|10|(And throw down thy staff) from your hand! And he threw it, (But when he saw it writhing) moving (as itwere a demon) like a serpent which is neither big nor small, (he turned to flee headlong) from it and did notlook back out of fear; but Allah said to him: (O Moses! Fear not! Lo! the emissaries fear not in My presence,
27|11|Save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good. And lo! I am Forgiving) I forgivethe one who repents, (Merciful) I show mercy towards he who dies in a state of repentance.
27|12|(And put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe) in your armpit, (it will come forth white but unhurt) withouthaving contracted leprosy. Go! ((This will be one) among nine tokens) go with nine signs (unto Pharaoh andhis people) the Copts. (Lo! they were ever evil-living folk) they were disbelievers.
27|13|(But when Our tokens came unto them) when Moses went with our tokens to them, (plain to see)demonstrating, one after the other, (they said: This is mere magic) what you have brought us, O Moses, is amanifest lie,
27|14|(And they denied them) they denied the tokens, (though their souls acknowledged them) after beingaccepted by their souls that they were from Allah, (for spite) out of opposition and enmity (and arrogance)and haughtiness and pride. (Then see) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence for the wrong-doers)how was the end result of the idolaters, Pharaoh and his people, how We destroyed them in the sea!
27|15|(And We verily gave knowledge) and understanding through prophethood and judgeship (unto David) theson of Jesse (and Solomon) the son of David, (and they said) both of them: (Praise be to Allah) thanks andgratitude to Allah, (Who hath preferred us) through knowledge and prophethood (above many of Hisbelieving slaves!
27|16|And Solomon was David's heir) as king instead of all the other sons of David who were 19 in number. (Andhe said) Solomon said: (O mankind! Lo! we have been taught) we were given the understanding of (thelanguage of birds, and have been given (abundance) of all things) and we were given the knowledge ofeverything in my kingdom. (This surely is evident favour) this is surely a great blessing from Allah.
27|17|(And there were gathered together) and made subservient (unto Solomon his armies of the jinn andhumankind, and of the birds, and they were set in battle order) they were all retained from the first to thelast until they were gathered together;
27|18|(Till, when they reached the Valley of the Ants) in Historic Syria, (an ant exclaimed: O ants! Enter yourdwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you) step on you, (unperceiving) unaware of you.
27|19|(And (Solomon) smiled, laughing) in amazement (at her speech) because he heard her speech while hisarmy did not, (and said: My Lord, arouse me) inspire in me (to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thouhast favoured me) you have blessed me with the profession of Allah's divine Oneness (and my parents)whom you also blessed with the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (and to do good) in all sincerity (thatshall be pleasing unto Thee) that you would accept (and include me in (the number of) Thy righteousslaves) and include me with Your righteous slaves in Paradise.
27|20|(And he sought among the birds) he inspected the birds (and said) when he could not see the hoopoeamong them: (How is it that I see not the hoopoe) in his place, (or is he among the absent?)
27|21|He said: if he is among the absent, then (I verily will punish him with hard punishment) I will pluck out hisfeathers; such was the punishment of the birds, (or I verily will slay him, or he verily shall bring me a plainexcuse) an acceptable excuse.
27|22|(But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not) O king!I reached a place that you have not reached and have come to know that which you do not, (and I comeunto thee from Sheba) the city of Sheba (with sure tidings) with an amazing, true information.
27|23|(Lo! I found a woman ruling over them) whose name is Balqis, (and she hath been given (abundance) of allthings) she has been given the knowledge of all things in her country, (and hers is a mighty throne) adornedwith gems, pearls, gold and silver.
27|24|(I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah; and Satan maketh their works) theirworship of the sun (fair-seeming unto them, and debarreth them from the way (of Truth)) the devil hasbarred them from the way of Truth and guidance, (so that they go not aright) to the way of truth andguidance:
27|25|(So that they worship not Allah) and I said to them: "O you, prostrate to Allah" it is also said that it isSolomon who said: "why do they not prostrate to Allah?" (Who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens) therain (and the earth) vegetation, (and knoweth what ye hide) of good and evil (and what ye proclaim) ofgood and evil,
27|26|(Allah; there is no God save Him, the Lord of the tremendous Throne.
27|27|(Solomon) said) to the hoopoe: (We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art of the liars.
27|28|Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them; then turn away) then move away such that they do notsee you (and see what (answer) they return) when they read my letter,
27|29|He did as Solomon commanded, and Balqis took the letter and went to meet her entourage. ((The Queen ofSheba) said: O chieftains! Lo! there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter) a sealed letter.
27|30|(Lo! it is from Solomon, and lo! it is) the first line of it is: (In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful;
27|31|Exalt not yourselves against me) feel not too haughty towards me, (but come unto me as those whosurrender) and seek peace; as well as demanding other things which were mentioned in the letter.
27|32|(She said: O chieftains! Pronounce for me in my case) inform me about what I should do; it is also said thatthis means: advise me about what to do. (I decide no case) I will not do anything (till ye are present withme) and advise me.
27|33|(They said: We are lords of might) we have weapons (and lords of great prowess) in war, (but it is for theeto command) we shall follow your command; (so consider what thou wilt command) and we will do it.
27|34|Then she pronounced words of wisdom. (She said: Lo! Kings) worldly kings, (when they enter a township)by force in instances of war and fighting, (ruin it) destroy it (and make the honour of its people shame) bybeating, killing and exposing them to other things. (Thus will they do) Allah said: this is how worldly kingsbehave because of arrogance.
27|35|(But lo! I am going to send a present unto them) to Solomon, (and to see with what (answer) themessengers return.
27|36|So when (the envoy) came unto Solomon) when her envoy went to Solomon, ((the King) said: What! Wouldye help me with wealth) with a gift? (But that which Allah hath given me) of prophethood and kingship (isbetter than that which He hath given you) of wealth. (Nay it is ye (and not I) who exult in your gift) if itwere to be returned to you.
27|37|(Return unto them) with their gift. (We verily shall come unto them with hosts) armies (that they cannotresist) which they have no power to stop, (and we shall drive them out from thence) from Sheba (withshame) with their hands tied to their necks, (and they will be abased) humiliated.
27|38|(He said) Solomon said: (O chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me,surrendering) and seeking peace?
27|39|(A) mighty (stalwart of the jinn) called 'Amr (said: I will bring it thee before thou canst rise from your place)before you leave your seat of judgement, for he used to sit for judgements until noon. (Lo! I verily amstrong and trusty for such work) even though it is adorned with gems, pearls, gold and silver.
27|40|Solomon said: I want it even quicker than that. (One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture) one whoknew Allah's greatest name, O Living, O Subsistent, who was called Asaf Ibn Barkhiyya (said: I will bring itthee before thy gaze returneth unto thee) before that thing which you see from far reaches you. (And whenhe saw it set in his presence) i.e. when he saw her throne next to his, (Solomon said) to Asaf: (This is of thebounty of my Lord) this is of the favour of my Lord, (that He may try me whether I give thanks) for hisblessings (or am ungrateful) or whether I abstain from being grateful for His blessings. (Whosoever giveththanks) for Allah's blessings (he only giveth thanks for (the good of) his own soul) for the reward of hisLord: (and whosoever is ungrateful) for the blessing of His Lord, he harms only his soul. (For lo! my Lord isAbsolute in independence) of his gratitude, (Bountiful) He forgives whoever repents, and He does not hastenhis punishment.
27|41|(He said: Disguise her throne for her) add to her throne and take away from it (that we may see whethershe will go aright) whether she will know (or be of those not rightly guided) or whether she will not know.
27|42|(So, when she came, it was said (unto her)) Solomon said to her: (Is thy throne like this? She said: (It is) asthough it were the very one. And (Solomon said): We were given the knowledge before her) Allah has givenme [knowledge], by changing her throne and bringing to me, even before she arrived, (and we hadsurrendered (to Allah)) and we were sincere before she arrived.
27|43|(And (all) that she was wont to worship) the sun (instead of Allah hindered her) Solomon stopped her; it isalso said that this means: Allah stopped her, (for she came of disbelieving folk) her folk were Zoroastrians.
27|44|(It was said unto her: Enter the hall) enter the castle. (And when she saw it she deemed it a pool and baredher legs) she lifted her dress above her legs. ((Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass)beneath which there is water, so do not be afraid of getting wet. (She said: My Lord! Lo! I have wrongedmyself) by worshipping the sun, (and I surrender with Solomon) at the hand of Solomon (unto Allah, theLord of the Worlds) the master of the jinn and human beings.
27|45|(And We verily sent until Thamud their brother) their Prophet (Salih, saying: Worship Allah) that you shouldsay to them: profess Allah's divine Oneness, and repent to Him from disbelief and idolatry. (And lo! they(then) became two parties) one believing and the other disbelieving, (quarrelling) regarding Religion.
27|46|(He said) Salih said to the disbelieving party: (O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil) the torment(rather than the good) rather than well-being and mercy? (Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah) why do younot repent of idolatry and denial and profess Allah's divine Oneness, (that ye may receive mercy) and escapethe torment.
27|47|(They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee) they meant: the hardship that we face is due to yourevil omen and the evil omen of those who believed in you. (He said) Salih said: (Your evil augury) yourhardship as well as your comfort (is with Allah) are from Allah. (Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested)by hardship and comfort; it is also said that this means: you are forsaken rather than being given success.
27|48|(And there were in the city nine persons) nine sinful people among the sons of their chieftains: Qaddar IbnSalif, Masda' Ibn Dahw and their host (who made mischief in the land) through their transgressions (andreformed not) they did not enjoy righteousness nor practised it.
27|49|(They said: Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and his household by night) and killthem all, (and afterward we will surely say unto his friend) to his inheritors and relatives: (We witnessed notthe destruction of his household) we did not witness the killing of Salih and his household. (And lo! we aretruth tellers) they will believe us and no one will reject what we say.
27|50|(So they plotted a plot) they planned to kill Salih and all those who believed with him: (and We plotted aplot) and We wanted to kill them, (while they perceived not) Our plotting; it is also said that this means: theangels killed them in the house of Salih by hailing stones at them without them perceiving it.
27|51|(Then see) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence of their plotting) the punishment for their plan tokill Salih, (for lo! We destroyed them) through raining stones on them (and their people, every one) and Wedestroyed every one of their people.
27|52|(See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong) because of their idolatry. (Lo!Herein) in that which We did to them (is indeed a portent) a sign and an admonition (for a people who haveknowledge) who believe in that which was done to them.
27|53|(And we saved those who believed) in Salih (and used to ward off (evil)) and used to ward off disbelief,idolatry and indecencies.
27|54|(And Lot!) We sent him to his people (when he said unto his folk: will you commit abomination) sodomy(knowingly) while knowing it to be an abomination?
27|55|(Must ye needs lust after men instead of women? Nay, but ye are folk who act senselessly) you are folk whoignore Allah's command.
27|56|(But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the household of Lot) Lot and his twodaughters: Za'ura and Raytha (from your township) Sodom, (for they (forsooth) are folk who would keepclean) they exonerate themselves from sodomy!
27|57|(Then we saved him and his household) his daughters (save his wife) the hypocrite; (We destined her to beof those who stayed behind) We decreed that she would stay behind to be destroyed.
27|58|(And We rained a rain) stones (upon them) upon their sodomites and travellers. (Dreadful) evil (is the rainof those who have been warned) by Lot but did not believe in him.
27|59|(Say) O Muhammad: (Praise be to Allah) thanks and gratitude to Allah for their destruction, (and peace)happiness and safety (be on His slaves whom He hath chosen!) whom He selected for prophethood; it isalso said that this means: Allah selected them for Islam, and these are the community of Muhammad (pbuh)(Is Allah best) say, O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: is the worship of Allah better, (or (all) that yeascribe as partners (unto Him)) or the worship of the idols which they associate with Allah?
27|60|(Is not He (best) who created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down for you water) rain (from thesky wherewith) by means of the rain (We cause to spring forth joyous) seemly (orchards) that whichsurrounds them of palm-trees and trees, (whose trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow) you neverhad the power to grow its trees. (Is there any God beside Allah) who has done this? (Nay, but they are folkwho ascribe equals (unto Him)) they make the idols as equals to Him!
27|61|(Is not He (best) Who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in the folds thereof) in the middlethereof, (and placed firm hills therein) on earth, (and hath set a barrier) preventing mixture (between thetwo seas) the sweet and salty seas?

27|65|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (None in the heavens) among angels (and the earth) amongcreated beings (knoweth the Unseen) the appointed time for the advent of the Hour and descent of torment(save Allah; and they know not) and created beings know not (when they will be raised (again)) from thegraves.
27|66|(Nay, but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter) their knowledge is in consensus that there is noHereafter? (Nay, for they are in doubt concerning it) concerning the coming of the Hour. (Nay, for theycannot see it) they are blind, unable to see.
27|67|(Yet those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: when we have become) scattered (dust like ourfathers) before us, (shall we verily be brought forth (again)) given life again and brought out of the graves?
27|68|(We were promised this) which you are promising us, (forsooth, we and our fathers) before us. ((All) this)which you are promising us, O Muhammad, (is naught but fables) tales (of the men of old.
27|69|Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Travel in the land and see) and take admonition from (thenature of the sequel for the guilty) how was the end of the idolaters!
27|70|(And grieve thou not) O Muhammad (for them) if they do not believe; it is also said that this means: do notgrieve for their destruction, (nor be in distress because of what they plot (against you)) and do not begrieved because of what they do and say against you.
27|71|(And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled)) when will come this promise that you so oftenpromised us, (if ye are truthful) that the torment is coming?
27|72|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (It may be) and "may be" when it comes from Allah denotes necessity (that apart of that which ye would hasten on) of punishment at the Day of Badr (is close behind you) is comingsoon.
27|73|(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (is full of bounty for mankind) for deferring His punishment, (but most of themdo not give thanks) for the deferment of punishment.
27|74|(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide) of hatred and enmity, (and all thatthey proclaim) and all that they display of disbelief, idolatry and aggression.
27|75|(And there is nothing hidden) secret (in the heaven or the earth) from the inhabitants of the heavens andthe earth (but it is in a clear Record) recorded in the Preserved or Guarded Tablet.
27|76|(Lo! this Qur'an) which you recite to them, O Muhammad, (narrateth unto the Children of Israel) explains toJews and Christians (most of that concerning which they differ) most of that which they oppose concerningReligion.
27|77|(And lo! It) i.e. the Qur'an (is a guidance) from error (and a mercy) shielding from the torment (forbelievers) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an.
27|78|(Lo! thy Lord will judge between them) between the Jews and Christians (of His wisdom) by His judgementand decree on the Day of Judgement, (and He is the Mighty) in retribution against them, (the Knower) Heknows them and knows their punishment.
27|79|(Therefore) O Muhammad (put thy trust in Allah, for thou (standest) on the plain Truth) Islam.
27|80|(Lo! thou canst not) O Muhammad (make the dead) of hearts; and it is said: those who are like the dead,(to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf) those whose hearts are dead; it is also said that this means: thosewho pretend to be deaf (to hear the call) your call to the Truth and guidance (when they have turned) turnaway (to flee) from the Truth and guidance;
27|81|(Nor canst thou) O Muhammad (lead the blind out of their error) to guidance. (Thou canst make none tohear) your call, (save those who believe Our revelations) Our Scripture and Messenger (and who havesurrendered) and are sincere in their worship and profession of Allah's divine Oneness.
27|82|(And when the word) bringing curse and torment upon them (is fulfilled concerning them, We shall bringforth a beast of the earth) between the Safa and al-Marwah, and this is the staff of Moses; it is also said thatthis beast will come with the staff of Moses (to speak unto them because mankind had not faith) they didnot believe (in Our revelations) i.e. in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; and it is also said that this means:they did not believe in the advent of the beast.
27|83|(And (remind them of) the Day) which is the Day of Judgement (when We shall gather out of every nation)from the adherents of every religion (a host) a group (of those who denied Our revelations) Our Book andMessenger, (and they will be set in array) they will be stopped from the first to the last, one after the other;
27|84|(Till, when they come (before their Lord)) gathered all together, (He will say) Allah will say to them: (Did yedeny My revelations) My Book and Messenger (when ye could not compass them in knowledge) He says:you denied them while you knew not that they did not come from Me, (or what was it that ye did) in yourdisbelief and idolatry?
27|85|(And the Word will be fulfilled concerning them) that they will incur a punishment and a curse (because theyhave done wrong) because of their disbelief and idolatry, (and they will not speak) they will not answerback.
27|86|(Have they not) the disbelievers of Mecca (seen how We have appointed the night that they may resttherein, and the day sight giving) and the day bright, so that they seek their livelihood? (Lo!

27|87|(And (remind them of) the Day when the Trumpet will be blown) this is the blowing of death, (and all whoare in the heavens) the angels (and the earth) of created beings (will start in fear) will die, (save him whomAllah wills) from among the dwellers of heaven: Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel and the angel of death, for thesewill not die upon the first blowing of the Trumpet, but they will die after that. (And all) i.e. the dwellers ofthe heavens and earth (come unto Him, humbled) they will come to Allah on the Day of Judgement abasedand humbled.
27|88|(And thou seest) O Muhammad upon the first blow of the trumpet (the hills thou deemest solid) and still(flying with the flight of clouds) in the air: (the doing of Allah) this is the doing of Allah with His creation(Who perfecteth all things) of creation. (Lo! He is Informed) Aware (of what ye do) of good or evil.
27|89|(Whoso bringeth a good deed) whoever comes on the Day of Judgement with "there is no god save Allah"sincerely believing in it (will have better than its worth) all his goodness derives from it; (and such are safefrom fear that Day) they are safe from fear and torment when the Fire is closed.
27|90|(And whoso bringeth an ill-deed) associating partners with Allah, (such will be flung down on their faces inthe Fire. Are ye rewarded) in the Hereafter (aught save what ye did) in this worldly life?
27|91|(Say) O Muhammad: (I am commanded only to serve) to confess the divine Oneness of (the Lord of thisland) i.e. Mecca (which He hath hallowed) which He made Sacred, (and unto Whom all things) amongcreated beings (belong.

27|92|(And to recite the Qur'an) I am commanded to recite the Qur'an to you. (And whoso goeth right) whoeverbelieves in what is in the Qur'an, (goeth right) believes (only for (the good of) his own soul) the reward ofhis faith goes to himself; (and as for him who goeth astray) disbelieves in the Qur'an ((Unto him) say) OMuhammad: (Lo! I am only a warner) I only warn you against the Fire by means of the Qur'an.
27|93|Allah then commanded him to fight, saying: (And say) O Muhammad: (Praise be to Allah) gratitude anddivine Oneness are Allah's (who will show you His portents) the signs of His divine Oneness and power byinflicting torment upon you on the Day of Badr (so that ye shall know them) so that you shall know thatwhat Muhammad (pbuh) tells you is true. (And your Lord is not unaware) oblivious (of what ye do) in yourstate of disbelief and idolatry. The reference here is to the disbelievers of Quraysh. This can also beconsidered a threat from Allah to them because of their disbelief and idolatry; it is also said that this means:Allah will not forgo the torment you deserve for your acts of plotting, treachery and corruption'.
28|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Ta. Sin. Mim.): '(Ta. Sin. Mim.) The (Ta) stands for His might (tawluh), the (Sin) for His majesty(sana'uh) and the (Mim) for His kingdom (mulkuh); it is also said that this is an oath by which He swore.

28|7|(And We inspired the mother of Moses) Jochabed the daughter of Levi, the son of Jacob (Yohabadh BintLawi Ibn Ya'qub), (saying: Suckle him) suckle this child (and, when you fear for him) to be lost, (then casthim into the river) put him in a chest and then throw the chest in the sea (and fear not) his drowning (norgrieve) for his loss, or because you think he will never return to you. (Lo! We shall bring him back unto theeand shall make him (one) of Our messengers) to Pharaoh and his people.
28|8|(And the family of Pharaoh) the maidens of Pharaoh (took him up) picked him from between the trees andwater and took him to the wife of Pharaoh, (that he might become for them an enemy) after he takes themessage to them (and a sorrow) for the loss of their kingdom. (Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hostswere ever sinning) they were idolaters.
28|9|(And the wife of Pharaoh) Asiyah Bint Muzahim, who was Moses' aunt (said: (He will be)) this child will be (aconsolation for me and for you) O Pharaoh. (Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us) in our farm,(or we may choose him for a son) or adopt him as a son. (And they perceived not) the Children of Israel didnot know that he was not from them; it is also said that this means: and they did not know that theirdestruction will be at his hands.
28|10|(And the heart of the mother of Moses) Jochabed (became void) from the preoccupation or mention ofanything other than Moses, (and she would have betrayed him) by admitting that Moses was her son afterbeing adopted by Pharaoh (if We had not fortified her heart) with patience, (that she might be of thebelievers) in the promise of Allah that he will be one of the messengers.
28|11|(And she) the mother of Moses (said unto his sister) the sister of Moses whose name was Mary: (Trace him.So she observed him) the child (from afar, and they perceived not) that she is the sister of Moses.
28|12|(And We had before forbidden foster-mothers) the milk of foster-mothers (for him) for Moses, (so she said)the sister of Moses said to the entourage of Pharaoh: (Shall I show you a household who will rear him)Moses (for you and take care of him) and she directed them to her mother?
28|13|(So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted) by having Moses (and not grieve) overhim, (and that she might know that the promise of Allah) to bring him back to her (is true. But most ofthem) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it.
28|14|(And when he reached his full strength) 18 years of age (and was ripe) he reached his 40th year, (We gavehim wisdom) understanding (and knowledge) prophethood. (Thus do We reward the good) i.e. the prophetsby bestowing upon them understanding and prophethood; it is also said that this means: thus do We rewardthe righteous by bestowing upon them knowledge and wisdom.
28|15|(And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk) when its folk were preoccupied, at the time ofthe siesta, and it is said after the Maghrib prayer, (and he found therein) in the city (two men fighting, oneof his own caste) of the caste of Moses, i.e. an Israelite, (and the other of his enemies) of the enemies ofMoses, i.e. a Copt; (and he who was of his caste) Moses' caste (asked him for help against him who was ofhis enemies) Moses' enemies. (So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said) Moses said: (This isof the devil's doing) by the devil's command. (Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleaders) whose enmity is quitemanifest. And he felt remorse for killing him.
28|16|(He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul) by killing a person, (so forgive me) my sin. (Then Heforgave him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful) towards he who repents.
28|17|(He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me) with knowledge and the profession of Your divineOneness and forgiveness, (I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty) do not make me a helper to theidolaters: Pharaoh and his host.
28|18|(And morning found him in the city, fearing) because of killing the Copt, (vigilant) anticipating arrest, (whenbehold! he who had appealed to him the day before) to help against the Copt (cried out to him for help)against another Copt. (Moses said unto him) to the Israelite: (Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead) you are aquarrelsome person, and proceeded to help him.
28|19|(And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both) i.e. the Copt, (he said)i.e. the Israelite said: (O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me) today (as thou didst kill a person) a Copt (yesterday.Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant) a murderer (in the land) of Egypt, (thou wouldst not be of thereformers) of the pious who enjoin good and forbid evil.
28|20|(And a man) Ezekiel (came from the uttermost part) and it is said from the centre (of the city, running. Hesaid: O Moses! Lo! the chiefs) the family of the man killed (take counsel against thee) they agreed (to slaythee; therefore escape) from the city. (Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice) I am of those who feelpity for you.
28|21|(So he escaped from thence) from the city, (fearing, vigilant) waiting and looking behind him expecting tobe hunted down and arrested. (He said) at this point: (My Lord! Deliver me from the wrong-doing folk) thepeople of Egypt.
28|22|(And when he turned his face towards Midian) he was afraid to miss the way, (he said: Peradventure myLord will guide me in the right road) leading to Midian.
28|23|(And when he came unto the water of Midian) a well in Midian (he found there a whole tribe of men) agroup of 40 men, (watering) their flocks. (And he found apart from them two women keeping, back (theirflocks)) until the men finished watering their flocks, due to their weakness. (He said: What aileth you) whatholds you back? (The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the water)until they finish watering their flocks; (and our father is a very old man) and does not have anyone to helphim except us.
28|24|(So he watered (their flock) for them) and they went back to their father to inform him about Moses. (Thenhe) Moses (turned aside into the shade) of a tree; and it is said: the shade of a wall; and it is said: theshade of a shelter, (and said) Moses said: (My Lord! I am needy of whatever good) food (Thou sendestdown for me) You have decreed for me.
28|25|(Then there came unto him one of the two women) the youngest of the two, whose name was Zipporah(Saffurah), (walking shyly) with her hand on her face. (She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he mayreward thee with a payment for that thou didst water (the flock) for us. Then, when he came unto him)when Moses went to Yathron, the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb who had died before (and told him) toldYathron (the (whole) story) of his escape from Pharaoh and the rest of it, (he said) Yathron said to him:(Fear not! thou hast escaped from the wrong-doing folk) the people of Egypt.
28|26|(One of the two women said) the youngest of the two women said: (O my father! Hire him! For the best(man) that thou canst hire is the strong) who can bear a heavy load, (the trustworthy) regarding that withwhich you entrust him.
28|27|(He said) Yathron said to Moses: (Lo! I fain would marry thee) O Moses (to one of these two daughters ofmine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me) to look after my flock (for (the term of) eight pilgrimages)eight years. (Then if thou completest ten) ten years (it will be of thine own accord) the increase of term willbe of your own accord, (for I would not make it hard for thee) by increasing the term. (Allah willing, thouwilt find me of the righteous) who fulfil their promise.
28|28|(He said) Moses said: (That (is settled) between thee and me) I agree to the conditions. (Whichever of thetwo terms I fulfil) eight or ten years, (there will be no injustice to me) after that you will have no right overme, (and Allah is Surety) Witness (over what we say) over the conditions agreed between us and theirfulfilment.
28|29|(Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term) ten years, (and was travelling with his housefolk) towards Egypt,(he saw in the distance a fire) he saw on the left side of the road a fire (and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye(here)) remain her. (Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence) from theFire camp, (or a brand from the Fire that ye may warm yourselves) because they were in the cold winter.
28|30|(And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley) from the right side of Moses (in theblessed field) blessed with trees and water, (from the tree) from the direction of the tree: (O Moses! Lo! I,even I, am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds) the Lord of the jinn and human beings;
28|31|(Throw down your staff) from your hand. (And when he saw it) after throwing it down (writhing) movingwith its head up (as it had been a demon) a serpent neither big nor small, (he turned to flee headlong) fromit, without looking back; but Allah said: (O Moses! Draw nigh) to it (and fear not) from it. (Lo! thou art ofthose who are secure) from its evil. When Moses picked it up, it was a staff like it was originally.
28|32|Allah then said to him: (Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe) in your armpit, O Moses, (it will comeforth white) shining like the rays of the sun (without hurt) without being afflicted with leprosy. (And guardthy heart) and put back your hand in your armpit after that (from fear) from the difference, if people getscared. (Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: Lo! they are evil-livingfolk) disbelievers who caused corruption because of their state of idolatry.
28|33|(He said) Moses said: (My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me) inretaliation.
28|34|(My brother Aaron is more eloquent then me in speech) because Moses had a slight speech impediment.(Therefore send him with me as a helper to confirm me) to speak on my behalf and confirm my words. (Lo!I fear that they will give the lie to me) deny the message I bring to them.
28|35|(He said) Allah said: (We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother) Aaron, (and We will give unto you bothpower) a proof and argument (so that they cannot reach you for Our portents) in order to kill you. (Yetwain, and those who follow you) by believing in you and the signs you bring, (will be the winners) againstPharaoh and his people.
28|36|(But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens) the hand and the staff, (they said) O Moses: (This)which you have brought us (is naught but invented magic) a lie which you have invented. (We never heardof this) which you are saying (among our fathers of old) among our deceased forefathers.
28|37|(And Moses said: My Lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance) who brings the message and the callfor the profession of Allah's divine Oneness (from His presence, and whose will be the sequel of the Home(of bliss)) Paradise in the Hereafter. (Lo! wrong-doers) the idolaters (will not be successful) they will not besaved from Allah's chastisement.
28|38|(And Pharaoh said: O chiefs) O men of Egypt! (I know not that ye have a god other than me) therefore donot obey Moses, (so kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower inorder that I may survey) I may climb up to (the God of Moses) whom he claims is in heaven and send himto me; (and lo! I deem him of the liars) there is no god in heaven.
28|39|(And he and his hosts) the Copts (were haughty) too proud to accept faith (in the land) of Egypt (withoutright) to do so, (and deemed that they would never be brought back to Us) in the Hereafter.
28|40|(Therefore We seized him) i.e. Pharaoh, because of what he said initially, "I am your exalted lord", and hisother claim: "I know not that you have a god other than me" (and his hosts) the Coptic people, (andabandoned them unto the sea) and cast them in the sea. (Behold) O Muhammad (the nature of theconsequence for evil-doers) how was the end of the idolaters: Pharaoh and his host!
28|41|(And We made them patterns) We forsook them (that invite unto) they were leaders to disbelief and error to(the Fire) to disbelief, idolatry and the worship of idols, (and on the Day of Resurrection they will not behelped) they will not be saved from the Fire.
28|42|(And We made a curse to follow them in this world) We destroyed them in this worldly life by drowning,(and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the hateful) they will have gloomy faces and bluisheyes.
28|43|(And We verily gave the Scripture) i.e. the Torah (unto Moses after We had destroyed the generations ofold) before Moses; (clear testimonies) a clarification (for mankind) for the Children of Israel, (and aguidance) from error (and a mercy) for those who believe in it, (that haply they might reflect) in order thatthey make take admonition and believe in it.
28|44|(And thou) O Muhammad (wast not on the western side (of the Mount) when We exposited unto Moses thecommandment) when We commanded Moses to go to Pharaoh, (and thou wast not among those present)there;
28|45|(But We brought forth) We created (generations) generation after generation, and explained the event ofthe former to the latter, just as We explained it to you, (and their lives dragged on for them) their lives wereprolonged, and when they did not believe We destroyed them. (And thou wast not) O Muhammad (a dwellerin Midian, reciting unto them Our revelations) reciting the Qur'an to your people, (but We kept sending(messengers to men)) to past generations and exposited to them the events of those who preceded themjust as We explained the events of the people of old to you.
28|46|(And thou wast not beside the Mount) of Zubayr (when We did call) Moses; and it is also said this means:when We called your nation; (but) We taught you and sent you as (a mercy) a blessing and a favour (fromthy Lord) for He sent Gabriel to you with the Qur'an containing the events of the people of old (that thoumayst warn) by means of the Qur'an (a folk unto whom no warner came before thee) no warningmessenger came to the people of Quraysh before, (that haply they may give heed) that haply they may takeadmonition and, hence, believe.
28|47|(Otherwise, if disaster should afflict them) if the chastisement of the Day of Judgement afflicted your people,the Quraysh, (because of that which their own hands have sent before (them)) because of what they hadearned in their state of disbelief, (they might say) upon the coming of the torment of the Day of Judgementon them: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Why sentest Thou no messenger unto us) with a Scripture before Youchastised us, (that we might have followed Your revelations) Your Scripture and Messenger (and been of thebelievers) in the Scripture and Messenger? If it were otherwise, We would have destroyed them before you,but We have sent them the Qur'an so that they do not have any excuse against Us.
28|48|(But when there came unto them the Truth) Muhammad (pbuh) with the Qur'an (from Our presence, theysaid) the disbelievers of Mecca said: (Why is he not) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (given the like of what wasgiven unto Moses) i.e. the hand, the staff, the quails and honey as well as the Qur'an? (Did they not) i.e. thedisbelievers of Mecca (disbelieve in that which was given unto Moses of old) i.e. the Torah before thecoming of Muhammad (pbuh)? (They say) the disbelievers of Mecca say: (Two magics) i.e. the Qur'an andthe Torah (that support each other; and they) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: Lo! in both we aredisbelievers) we disbelieve in both the Qur'an and the Torah.
28|49|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Then bring a Scripture from the presence of Allah that giveth clearerguidance) more sound (than these two) the Qur'an and the Torah ((that) I may follow it) that I may actaccording to it, (if ye are truthful) that the Qur'an and Torah are two magics that support each other.
28|50|When they could not bring a Scripture, Allah said: (And if they answer thee not) if the wrong-doers do notproduce that which you have asked them, (then know that what they follow is their lusts) through disbelief,idolatry and idol worship. (And who goeth farther astray) from the Truth and guidance (than he whofolloweth his lust) through disbelief, idolatry, and idol worship (without guidance from Allah) without proofor exposition from Allah. (Lo! Allah guideth not) to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters: Abu Jahl andhis host.
28|51|(And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them) We explained to them the Qur'an and its messageof divine Oneness, (that haply they may give heed) so that they may take admonition from the Qur'an andbelieve in it.
28|52|(Those unto whom We gave the Scripture) the knowledge of the Scripture (before it) before the advent ofMuhammad, Allah bless him and give peace, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers who were about 40men, some of whom came from Historic Syria and others from Yemen, (they believe in it) they believe inMuhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an,
28|53|(And when it is recited unto them) and when the Qur'an is recited to them expositing the attributes anddescription of Muhammad (pbuh) (they say: We believe in it) we believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and in theQur'an. (Lo! it is the Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it) before the recitation of the Qur'an to us (wewere of those who surrender (unto Him)) we were of those who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and theQur'an.
28|54|(These) those whose traits are thus (will be given their reward twice over, because they are steadfast) in theface of the harm and vilification coming from the disbelievers whenever they showed the attributes anddescription of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in their own Scriptures or embraced the religion ofMuhammad (pbuh) (and repel evil with good) they repel idolatry from others by means of "there is no deityexcept Allah", (and spend) and give to charity (of that wherewith We have provided them) of wealth,
28|55|(And when they hear vanity) falsehood, i.e. being vilified by the disbelievers (they withdraw from it) in anhonourable way (and say) kindly: (Unto us our works) the worship of Allah and the religion of Islam (andunto you your works) upon you is the onus of your works: the worship of idols, the religion of the devil andthe association of partners with Allah. (Peace be unto you!) May Allah guide you! (We desire not theignorant) we do not seek the religion of those who associate partners with Allah.
28|56|(Lo! thou) O Muhammad (guidest not) know not (whom thou lovest) i.e. whom you love to accept faith: i.e.Abu Talib, (but Allah guideth) He gives success and leads (whom He will) to His religion: Abu Bakr, 'Umarand their fellow believers. (And He is best aware of those who walk aright) to His religion.
28|57|(And they say) i.e. Harth Ibn 'Amr al-Nawfali and his host: (If we were to follow the Guidance) theconfession of Allah's divine Oneness (with thee) O Muhammad (we should be torn out) expelled (of ourland) Mecca. (Have We not established for them) We made them dwell in (a sure sanctuary) free of turmoil,(whereunto the produce of all things is brought (in trade), a provision from Our presence?) A sustenance forthem from Us, so how am I to set the disbelievers on them if they were to believe? (But most of them knownot) this nor believe in it.
28|58|(And how many a community) how many inhabitants of a community (have We destroyed that wasthankless for its means of livelihood!

28|59|(And never did thy Lord destroy the townships) the inhabitants of any township, (till He had raised up intheir mother (-town)) their greatest town, i.e. Mecca; it is also said that this means: until He sends to theirleaders and chiefs (a messenger reciting unto them Our revelations) explaining the commands andprohibitions. (And never did We destroy the townships) the inhabitants of any township (unless the folkthereof were evil-doers) idolaters.
28|60|(And whatsoever ye have been given) whatever you are given of wealth and servants, (is a comfort of thelife of the world) is like the ornament of the life of the world: like pottery and glass (and an ornamentthereof) and an embellishment, and the latter does not last forever; (and that which Allah hath) forMuhammad and his Companions in Paradise (is better and more lasting) than that which you have in the lifeof the world. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not possess sound thinking to realise that this worldly life isperishing while the Hereafter is lasting?
28|61|(Is he whom We have promised a fair promise) Paradise; the reference here is to Muhammad (pbuh) andhis Companions; it is also said that the reference is to 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan (which he will find (true)) in theHereafter (like him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world) like him whom Wegave wealth and servants in the life of the world; the reference here is to Abu Jahl, (then on the Day ofResurrection he will be of those arraigned) of those who are tormented in hell?
28|62|(On the Day) which is the Day of Judgement (when He) i.e. Allah (will call unto them) Abu Jahl and his host(and say) and Allah, glorified is He, says: (Where are My partners whom you imagined) whom youworshipped and claimed they were my partners?

28|65|(And on the Day) of Judgement (when He will call unto them) Allah will call unto the disbelievers (and say:What answer gave ye to the messengers) regarding that for which they invited you?
28|66|(On that day) the Day of Judgement ((all) tidings) the events and answer (will be dimmed) confused (forthem, nor will they ask one of another) they will not answer one another,

(Then they will know) each nationwill know (that Allah hath the Truth) that the worship of Allah and the religion of Allah are the Truth, andthat their judgement is up to Allah, (and all that they invented) all that which they falsely worshipped (willhave failed them) will become too preoccupied with themselves to help them.
28|76|(Now Korah was of Moses folk) He was Moses' cousin, (but he oppressed them) but he transgressed againstMoses, Aaron and their folk.

28|83|(As for that Abode of the Hereafter) Paradise (We assign it unto those who seek not oppression) andhaughtiness (in the earth) through their wealth, (nor yet corruption) by means of carvings, statues andtransgressions. (The sequel) Paradise (is for those who ward off (evil)) those who ward off disbelief,idolatry, haughtiness and corruption in the earth.
28|84|(Whoso bringeth a good deed) the sincere profession of "there is no god except Allah", (he will have betterthan the same) he will reap goodness from it; (while as for him who bringeth an ill deed) associatingpartners with Allah, (those who do ill deeds) associating partners with Allah (will be requited only what theydid) the Fire.
28|85|(Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur'an for a law) He Who has sent you Gabriel with the Qur'an (will surelybring you again to the place of return) to Mecca; and it is said: to Paradise. (Say) O Muhammad: (My Lord isbest aware of he who bringeth guidance) the profession of Allah's divine Oneness and the Qur'an (and himwho is in error manifest) and him who is in manifest disbelief and error.
28|86|(Thou hadst no hope) O Muhammad (that the Scripture would be inspired in thee) that Gabriel would comedown to you with the Qur'an and that you will be a prophet; (but it is a mercy from your Lord) but it is ablessing and honour from your Lord that He sent down Gabriel to you with the Qur'an, (so never be a helperto the disbelievers) by disbelieving.
28|87|(And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah) from the Qur'an (after they have been sent downunto thee) through Gabriel; (but call (mankind) unto thy Lord) call to the profession of Allah's divineOneness and Book of your Lord, (and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto turn)) do not be with theidolaters, following their religion.

(His is the command) thejudgement between people, (and unto Him ye will be brought back) after death and he will requite eachaccording to his works'.
29|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Alif. Lam. Mim.): '(Alif. Lam. Mim.) He says: I am Allah, I know; it is also said that it is an oath bywhich Allah swore because of His saying: (Lo! We tested those who were before you).
29|2|(Do men) do the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (imagine that they will be left) that they be given areprieve after Muhammad (pbuh) (because they say, We believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an,(and will not be tested with affliction) and will not be tried with caprice, blameworthy innovations and theviolation of sanctities?
29|3|(Lo! We tested those who were before you) before the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) after the demiseof their prophets, with caprice, blameworthy innovations and the violation of sanctities. (Thus Allahknoweth) in order that Allah sees and distinguishes (those who are sincere) in their faith by avoiding caprice,blameworthy innovation and by shunning that which is unlawful, (and knoweth those who feign) i.e. theinsincere in their faith who follow caprice, blameworthy innovation and the violation of sanctities.
29|4|The following was revealed about Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah and 'Utbah and Shaybahthe sons of Rabi'ah who had duals with 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, Hamzah Ibn'Abd al-Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet (pbuh) and 'Ubaydah Ibn al-Harth Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib on the Dayof Badr; some of them boasted to others, and so Allah said: (Or do those who do ill deeds) in their state ofassociating partners with Allah (imagine that they can outstrip Us) that they will evade Our punishment: (Evil(for them) is that which they decide) evil is that which they judge and think for themselves.
29|5|(Whoso looketh forward to) whoever fears (the meeting with Allah (let him know that) Allah's reckoning)resurrection after death (is surely nigh) will surely happen, (and He is the Hearer) of what both parties saidon the Day of Badr, (the Knower) of that which befalls them.
29|6|It was then revealed about 'Ali and his two fellow companions and the boasting they had uttered: (Andwhosoever striveth) in the way of Allah on the Day of Badr, (striveth only for himself) he has the reward ofthat, (for lo! Allah is altogether Independent of (His) creatures) He is free of need for the striving of Hiscreatures.
29|7|(And as for those who believe) 'Ali and his two fellow companions (and do good works) and perform acts ofobedience between themselves and their Lord, (We shall remit from them their evil deeds) We shall expiatetheir minor sins but not the enormities they commit (and shall repay them the best that they did) in theirstriving.

(Unto Me is your return) your return as well as your parents' (and I shalltell you what ye used to do) of good and evil in your state of faith or disbelief.
29|9|(And as for those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) acts ofobedience between them and their Lord at all times, (We verily shall make them enter in among therighteous) with the righteous in Paradise: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (the Veracious), 'Umar al-Faruq (theDistinguisher (between good and evil)), 'Uthman of the two lights, and 'Ali the trustworthy, may Allah bewell pleased with all of them.
29|10|(Of mankind) this is 'Ayyash Ibn Abi Rabi'ah al-Makhzumi (is he who saith: We believe in Allah) we aresincere in our profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (but, if he be made to suffer for the sake of Allah) if he istortured for the sake of Allah's religion, (he mistaketh the persecution of mankind) their flogging (for Allah'spunishment) in the Fire; such that he abandons Islam and reverts to his old religion; (and then, if victorycometh from your Lord) the conquest of Mecca, (will say) 'Ayyash and his host will say: (Lo! we were withyou (all the while)) following your religion. (Is not Allah best aware of what is in the bosoms of (His)creatures) of good and evil? 'Ayyash and his friends embraced Islam afterwards and lived as good Muslims.
29|11|(Verily Allah knoweth) He sees and distinguishes (those who believe) in private and openly, (and verily Heknoweth) He sees and distinguishes (the hypocrites) on the Day of Badr.
29|12|(Those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca, Abu Jahl and his host (say unto those who believe) 'Ali,Salman [al-Farisi] and their fellow believers: (Follow our way) our religion which consists of worshippingidols (and we verily will bear your sins (for you)) on the Day of Judgement. (They cannot bear aught of theirsins) on the Day of Judgement. (Lo! they verily are liars) regarding what they claim.
29|13|(But they verily will hear their own loads) their sins on the Day of Judgement (and other loads) the sins ofthose they misled (beside their own) in addition to their own sins, (and they verily will be questioned on thenay of Resurrection concerning that which they invented) concerning their lie against Allah.
29|14|(And verily We sent Noah (as Our messenger) unto his folk, and he continued with them for a thousandyears save fifty years) calling them to profess Allah's divine Oneness but they did not respond to him; (andthe flood engulfed them) and Allah destroyed them by the flood, (for they were wrong-doers) they weredisbelievers.
29|15|(And We rescued him) Noah (and those with him in the ship) and those who believed in him who wereaboard the ship, (and made of it) i.e. the ship of Noah (a portent) a lesson (for the peoples) after them.
29|16|(And Abraham! (Remember)) and We sent Abraham to his people (when he said unto his folk: serve Allah)declare Allah's divine Oneness, (and keep your duty unto Him) fear him and obey Him by repenting fromdisbelief, idolatry and idol worship; (that is better for you) than the state in which you are now (if ye did butknow) this and believe in it; but neither do you know this nor believe in it.
29|17|(Ye serve instead of Allah only idols) stones, (and ye only invent a lie) carving with your own hand what youworship beside Allah.

29|18|(But if ye deny) the message brought by Muhammad (pbuh) (then nations have denied before you) themessages brought by their messengers and We destroyed them as a consequence. (The messenger is onlyto convey (the Message) plainly) on behalf of Allah in a language they understand.

(For such there is a painful doom.
29|24|But the answer of his folk was) the response of Abraham's folk when he called them to believe in Allah was(only that they said: "Kill him" or "Burn him".) or throw him in the Fire. (Then Allah saved him from the Fire)without harm. (Lo! Herein) in that which We did with the folk of Abraham (verily are portents) lessons (forfolk who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an.
29|25|(He said) Abraham said to his people: (Ye have chosen) you have worshipped (idols) stones (instead ofAllah.

(Then on theDay of Resurrection ye will deny each other) you absolve yourselves from each other (and curse each other,and your abode) your destination (will be the Fire) i.e. the worshipper and the worshipped, (and ye will haveno helpers) to save you from Allah's torment.
29|26|(And Lot believed him) he believed in Abraham, (and said) and Abraham said: (Lo! I am a fugitive unto myLord) I am returning to the obedience of my Lord; and he left Harran for Palestine. (Lo! He, only He, is theMighty) in retribution against them, (the Wise) He decreed that one should move from one country toanother for growth and the protection of one's religion.
29|27|(And We bestowed on him) on Abraham (Isaac) as a son (and Jacob) as a grandson, (and We establishedthe prophethood and the Scripture among his seed) He says: We honoured his progeny with prophethoodand Scriptures and righteous offspring; for there were among them prophets and Scriptures, (and We gavehim his reward in the world) We honoured him with prophethood, a good reputation and righteous offspringin this worldly life, (and lo! in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous) with his forefathers, themessengers, in Paradise.
29|28|(And Lot!) We sent Lot to his folk ((Remember) when he said unto his folk: Lo! ye commit lewdness)sodomy (such as no creature did before you) He said: no one before has ever committed your abominableact.
29|29|(For come ye not in unto males) do you not have sexual intercourse with men, (and cut ye not the road (fortravellers)) and it is also said that this means: you cut off the continuation of progeny by your abominableact, (and commit ye not abomination in your meetings) they used to indulge in ten different kinds ofindecency? (But the answer of his folk) the folk of Lot (was only that they said: Bring Allah's doom upon us ifthou art a truth-teller) if you are true that we will be punished unless we accept faith!
29|30|(He said) Lot said: (My Lord! Give me victory) by sending Your punishment (over folk who work corruption)on the idolaters.
29|31|(And when Our messengers) Gabriel and the angels who were with him (brought Abraham the good news)that he will have a son, (they said) to Abraham: (Lo! we are about to destroy the people of that township)the township of Lot, (for its people are wrong-doers) they are idolaters who brought destruction uponthemselves because of their abominable acts.
29|32|(He said) Abraham said: (Lo! Lot is there) so how could you destroy them, O Gabriel? (They) i.e. Gabriel andthe angels with him (said: We are best aware of who is there.

29|33|(And when Our messengers) Gabriel and the angels who were with him (came unto Lot, he was troubledupon their account) he disliked their coming, (for he could not protect them) from the abominable act of hispeople; (but they) Gabriel and the angels (said: Fear not) for us, (nor grieve) about us, for fear of our peril!(Lo! we are to deliver you) from your people (and your household) and your two daughters, ((all) save yourwife) the hypocrite, (who is of those who stay behind) and be destroyed.

(Nonedenieth Our signs) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (save every traitor ingrate) who disbelieves in Allahand is ungrateful for His bounties.
31|33|(O mankind) O people of Mecca!

32|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying(Alif. Lam. Mim.): '(Alif. Lam. Mim.) He says: I am Allah, I know; it is also said that it is an oath by whichAllah swore.
32|2|(The revelation of the Scripture) this Scripture is Allah's speech addressed to you (whereof there is nodoubt) there is no doubt that it (is from the Lord of the Worlds.

(Nay, butit) i.e. the Qur'an (is the Truth from thy Lord) Gabriel brought down to you, (that thou mayst warn a folk)i.e. the Quraysh (to whom no warner came before you) no warning messenger came to them before you, OMuhammad, (that haply they may walk aright) that they may be guided from error.

32|10|(And they say) i.e. Abu Jahl and his host: (When we are lost) perished (in the earth) after we die, (how canwe then be recreated) it is impossible that we be recreated after we die? (Nay but they are disbelievers in)they deny (the meeting with their Lord) resurrection after death.

(They are notalike) in the life of this world in relation to their obedience nor are they alike in the Hereafter in relation tothe reward and honour bestowed by Allah. This is because these two had an argument and exchangedwords until 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, said to him: "O sinner!".
32|19|Allah then explained the destination of both of them after they die, saying: (But as for those who believe) inMuhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (for them are theGardens of Retreat) as a reward for them in the Hereafter, (a welcome (in reward) for what they used todo) of good works in the life of this world.

32|25|(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (will judge between them) between the believer and disbeliever; it is also said:between the Children of Israel (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein) in Religion (they usedto differ) they used to oppose.

33|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah): '(O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah) He says: fear Allah inrelation to breaking your pledge before the time of its expiry (and obey not the disbelievers) from amongthe people Mecca: Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, 'Ikrimah Ibn Abi Jahl and Abu'l-A'war al-Aslami (and the hypocrites)of Medina: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and Jadd Ibn Qays; do not obey them inwhat they ask you to commit of transgression. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of what they say and of their intent tokill you, (Wise) He enjoined that one should honour one's pledge and forbade breaking pledges.
33|2|(And follow) O Muhammad (that which is inspired in thee from your Lord) act according to what you havebeen commanded in the Qur'an. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what ye do) whether you honour your pledge orbreak it.
33|3|(And put thy trust in Allah, for Allah is Sufficient as Trustee) He is sufficient to fulfil His promise to you: togive you victory and the upper hand; it is also said that this means: He is sufficient to protect you fromthem.
33|4|(Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body) this was revealed about Abu Ma'marJamil Ibn Asad who was called "the one with two hearts" because of his measured speech, (nor hath Hemade your wives whom ye declare (to be your mothers)) by a simple oath ((to be your mothers) yourmothers) as your mother in relation to unmarriageability-this was revealed about Aws Ibn al-Samit thebrother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit and his wife Khawlah-, (nor hath he made those whom ye claim (to be yoursons)) those whom you adopted in order to help and strengthen you (your sons) like your real sons. (This isbut a saying of your mouths) between yourselves. (But Allah saith the Truth) Allah explains the Truth (andHe showeth the way) and lead to what is right.
33|5|(Proclaim their real parentage) name them in relation to their real fathers. (That will be more equitable)better, more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah) in relation to lineage. (And if ye know not their fathers)if you do not know the lineage of their fathers, (then (they are) your brethren in the faith) name them withnames showing brotherhood in faith: 'Abdullah, 'Abd al-Rahman, 'Abd al-Rahim and 'Abd al-Raziq, (and yourclients) and name them as your clients. (And there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye makeunintentionally) regarding the identification of one's parentage, (but what your hearts purpose (that will be asin for you)) what is a sin for you is to attribute intentionally someone to other than his real father. (Allah isForgiving) of what was done in the past, (Merciful) in relation to what will happen in the future. This versewas revealed about Zayd Ibn Harithah who was adopted by the Prophet (pbuh). People used to call himZayd Ibn Muhammad, but Allah forbade them from calling him so and guided them to what is proper.
33|6|He said: (The Prophet is closer to the believers) the Prophet has a better right to preserve the children ofthe believers (than their selves) after they die, due to the saying of the Prophet (pbuh): "Whoever dies andleaves behind a burden I will carry it for him, or a debt I will pay it back for him, or wealth it will go to hisinheritors", (and his wives) the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) (are (as) their mothers) are like their mother inunmarriageability. (And the owners of kinship) those related with ties of kinship (are closer one to another)have more right to one another in relation to inheritance (in the ordinance of Allah) thus it is written in theGuarded Tablet; and it is said: thus it is written in the Torah; and it is said: thus it is written in the Qur'an(than (other) believers and the fugitives (who fled from Mecca) except that ye should do kindness) abequest not exceeding a third of the whole inheritance (to your friends) your custodians in religion or yourfriends. (This) inheritance for relatives and bequests for friends or clients (is written in the Book) in theGuarded Tablet; it is also said: it is written in the Torah and the Children of Israel practise it.
33|7|(And when We exacted a covenant from the Prophets) to honour their pledges and that they should conveythe message to one another, (and from thee (O Muhammad)) and We exacted from you that you shouldconvey to your people the events of the messengers and Scriptures before you and that you shouldcommand them to believe in it (and from Noah) and We exacted from Noah [the same] (and Abraham) andexacted from Abraham [the same] (and Moses) and exacted from Moses [the same] (and Jesus son of Mary)and exacted from Jesus of Mary [the same]. (We took from them a solemn covenant) that they shouldconvey the message, the first to the last and that the last should believe in the first, and also command theirrespective people to believe in it;
33|8|(That He may ask the loyal of their loyalty) that He may ask the conveyors of the message about theirconveyance, and the loyal about their loyalty and the believers about their faith. (And He hath prepared apainful doom) whose pain extends to their hearts (for the unfaithful) for the disbelievers in Scriptures andmessengers.
33|9|(O ye who believe Remember Allah's favour unto you) preserve Allah's favour in that He repelled the enemyfrom you by sending the east wind and angels (when there came against you hosts) the host of disbelievers,(and We sent against them a great wind) the east wind (and hosts) and a row of angels (you could not see.And Allah is ever Seer of what ye do) whether it is the digging of the trench or other things.
33|10|(When they) the disbelievers of Mecca (came upon you from above you) from above the valley: Talhah IbnKhuwaylid al-Asdi and his host (and from below you) from below the valley: Abu'l-A'war al-Aslami and hishost and Abu Sufyan and his host, (and when eyes grew wild) when the eyes of the hypocrites grew wild(and hearts) the hearts of the hypocrites (reached to the throats) because of fear, (and ye were imaginingvain thoughts concerning Allah) and thought, O host of hypocrites, that Allah will not help His prophet.
33|11|(There) at that point of fear (were the believers sorely tried) they were tested with a trial, (and shaken witha mighty shock) they were terribly exhausted and violently moved.
33|12|(And When the hypocrites) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul and his host, (and those in whose hearts is adisease) doubt and hypocrisy, i.e. Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and his host, (were saying: Allah and His messengerpromised us naught) the conquests of lands and the coming of the believers (but delusion) falsehood.
33|13|(And when a party of them) from Banu Harithah Ibn al-Harth to their friends in the Ditch (said: O folk ofYathrib!) they mean: O people of Medina! (There is no stand (possible) for you) there is no place for you inthe Ditch to fight, (therefore turn back) to Medina. (And certain of them) from the hypocrites among BanuHarithah ((even) sought permission of the Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, (saying) allow us, OProphet of Allah, to go back to Medina: (Our homes lie open (to the enemy)) there are no men in our homesand we fear that thieves may steal from them. (And they lay not open) and they are not without men. (Theybut wished to flee) from fighting.
33|14|(If the enemy had entered) in on the hypocrites in Medina (from all sides and they had been exhorted totreachery) to idolatry, (they would have committed it) they would have swiftly committed it, (and wouldhave hesitated thereupon but little) they would not have hesitated to respond; it is also said that this means:they would have remained in Medina but a little while.
33|15|(And verily they had already sworn unto Allah) before the battle of the Ditch, on the occasion of the battle ofthe Clans (that they would not turn their backs) fleeing from the idolaters. (An oath to Allah) the one whobreaks his oath to Allah (must he answered for) will be asked about it on the Day of Judgement.
33|16|(Say) O Muhammad, to Banu Harithah: (Flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing, and then yedwell in comfort) you will not live in the life of this world (but a little while) a short time.
33|17|(Say) O Muhammad to Banu Harithah: (Who is he who can preserve you from Allah) from Allah'schastisement (if He intendeth harm for you) if He intends to punish you by killing you, (or intendeth mercyfor you) or intends well-being for you by sparing you from being killed. (They will not find) i.e. BanuHarithah (that they have any friend or helper other than Allah) that they have anyone to spare them from orhelp them against Allah's chastisement.
33|18|(Allah already knoweth those of you) those of the hypocrites (who hinder) others to go back to the Ditch,(and those who say unto their brethren) and those who say to their friends who are also hypocrites: ("Comeye hither unto us!") in Medina; these were: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, Jadd Ibn Qays and Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr(and they) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his two friends (come not to the stress of battle) come not to fighting(save a little) out of ostentatious and seeking fame,
33|19|(Being sparing of their help to you (believers)) they claimed they took pity on the believers; it is also saidthat this means: they are too niggardly when it is a question of spending on the believers. (But when thefear) of the enemy (cometh, then thou (Muhammad) seet them) the hypocrites in the Ditch (regarding theewith rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death) like the one suffering from the pangs of death. (Then,when the fear) of the enemy (departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues) they attack and vilify you (intheir greed for wealth (from the spoil)) they are stingy when it comes to spending in the way of Allah.(Such) those who have such traits (have not believed) are not sincere in their faith. (Therefore Allah makeththeir deeds fruitless) Allah thwarts their good deeds by means of their evil works. (And that) thwarting gooddeeds (is easy for Allah).
33|20|(They hold that the clans) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host think that the disbelievers of Mecca (have notretired (for good)) because of their fear and cowardice; it is also said: they think that the disbelievers ofMecca will not leave until they kill Muhammad (pbuh); (and if the clans) the disbelievers of Mecca (shouldadvance (again), they) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (would fain be in the desert with the wanderingArabs) they would wish to leave Medina because of their fear and cowardice, (asking) in Medina (for thenews of you) about your situation in the Ditch (and if they were among you) and if they were with you inthe Ditch, (they would not give battle, save a little) out of ostentation and seeking fame.
33|21|(Verily in the Messenger of Allah ye have a good example) a good wont and goodly imitation in staying withhim in the Ditch (for him who looketh unto Allah) for he who longs for Allah's bounty and reward; it is alsosaid that this means: for he who fears Allah (and the last Day) and fears the chastisement of the Hereafter,(and remembereth Allah much) with his tongue and heart.
33|22|Allah then mentioned the attributes of sincere believers, saying: (And when the true believers) the sincerebelievers (saw the clans) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Sufyan and his host, (they said: This is that whichAllah and His messenger promised us) for the counting of days. (Allah and His messenger are true) in theirpromise, this is because the Prophet (pbuh) had informed them that the Clans will come and remain for nineto ten days, i.e. up to nine or ten days. (It) seeing the disbelievers (did but confirm them in their faith) itincreased their certitude in the words of Allah and in the words of His Messenger (and resignation) to thecommand of Allah and to the command of the Messenger.
33|23|(Of the believers are men who are true) loyal (to that which they covenanted with Allah. Some of them havepaid their vow by death (in battle)) such as Hamzah Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, uncle of the Prophet (pbuh) andhis fellow believers who died fighting, (and some of them still are waiting) they will continue to be loyal untilthey die; (and they have not altered) the covenant (in the least) by breaking it;
33|24|(That Allah may reward the true men for their truth) that Allah may reward the loyal for their loyalty, (andpunish the hypocrites if He will) if they die as hypocrites, (or relent towards them (if He will)) before theydie. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives those who repent, (Merciful) he shows mercy towards those who dierepentant.
33|25|(And Allah repulsed the disbelievers) of Mecca: Abu Sufyan and his host (in their wrath) in their rancour;(they gained no good) they gained no happiness, booty or the upper hand. (Allah averted their attack fromthe believers) Allah relieved the believers from fighting by sending the wind and the angels. (Allah is Strong)in helping the believers, (Mighty) in retribution against the disbelievers.
33|26|(And He brought those of the People of the Scripture) they are Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir: Ka'b IbnAshraf and Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and their hosts (who supported them) who supported the disbelievers ofMecca (down from their strongholds) from their mansions and towers, (and cast panic into their hearts) fromMuhammad (pbuh) and his Companions, whereas before that they did not fear them and fought againstthem. (Some you slew) He says: you kill some of them, you sentence them to death, (and you made captivesome) their children and women.
33|27|(And He caused you to inherit their land) their mansions (and their houses and their wealth) He made theirwealth booty for you, (and land) the land of Khaybar (ye have not trodden) which did not belong to you butwhich will soon belong to you. (Allah is Able to do all things) whether it is a conquest or assistance.
33|28|(O Prophet!) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (Say unto thy wives: If ye desire the world's life) what is in the life ofthis world (and its adornment) and its splendour, (come! I will content you) with divorce (and will releaseyou with a fair release) according to the Sunnah.

33|30|(O ye wives of the Prophet! Whosoever of you committeth manifest lewdness) plain adultery with witnessesto testify against you, (the punishment for her will be doubled) flogging and stoning, (and that) punishment(is easy for Allah.

33|32|(O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women) you are not like the rest of women in relationto transgression, obedience, reward and punishment. (If ye keep your duty (to Allah)) if you obey Allah andHis Messenger, (then be not soft of speech) with strangers, (lest he in whose heart is a disease) lust foradultery (aspire (to you), but utter customary speech) straight speech, containing no ambiguity.
33|33|(And stay in your houses) and do not go out and display gravity. (Bedizen not yourselves with thebedizenment of the Time of Ignorance) and do not adorn yourselves with the adornment of the disbelieversin their thin, colourful clothes. (Be regular in prayer) perform the five daily prayers, (and pay the poor-due)from your wealth, (and obey Allah and His messenger) in that which is customary. (Allah's wish) in this (isbut to remove uncleanness) sin (far from you, O Folk of the Household) of the Prophet, (and cleanse you)from sins (with a thorough cleansing.

33|35|Then it was revealed about Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (pbuh) and Nusaybah Bint Ka'b al-Ansariyyah who said: "O Messenger of Allah!

33|36|(And it becometh not a believing man) Zayd (or a believing woman) Zaynab, (when Allah and His messengerhave decided and affair (for them)) to marry them, (that they should (after that) claim any say in theiraffair) they should not have any choice other than what Allah and His Messenger chose for them; (andwhoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger) and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger in what heis commanded with, (he verily goeth astray in error manifest) he is in manifest error regarding Allah'scommand.
33|37|(And when thou saidst unto him on whom Allah hath conferred favour) through Islam, i.e. Zayd (and thouhast conferred favour) on him by emancipating him: (Keep thy wife to thyself) and do not divorce her, (andfear Allah) and fear Allah and do not let her go. (And thou didst hide in your mind) her love and the desireto marry her (that which Allah was to bring to light) in the Qur'an, (and thou didst fear mankind) and youfeel ashamed of people because of this (whereas Allah had a better right that thou shouldst fear Him)whereas you should be ashamed of Allah. (So when Zayd had performed the necessary formality (of divorce)from her) when she has finished her waiting period after her divorce from Zayd, (We gave her unto thee inmarriage, so that (henceforth)) after you (there may be no sin for believers about wives of their adoptedsons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them) when they hadfinished their waiting period after they are divorced or after the death of their husband.

33|38|(There is no reproach) there is no sin or offence (for the Prophet in that which Allah maketh his due) in thedispensation Allah makes for him, by making him marry. (That was Allah's way) thus was Allah's decree(with those who passed away of old) before Muhammad (pbuh); the reference here is to David and hismarriage to the wife of Uriya; and it is also said that this refers to the marriage of Solomon with Balqis (andthe commandment of Allah is certain destiny) the decree of Allah must necessarily take place.
33|39|(Who delivered the messages of Allah) i.e. David, Solomon and Muhammad (and feared Him) they fear Allahupon conveying the message, (and feared none save Allah. Allah keepeth good account) Allah is Witness.
33|40|(Muhammad is not the father of any man among you) i.e. Zayd, (but he is the Messenger of Allah) butMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah (and the Seal of the Prophets) with him Allah has sealed the advent ofprophets, such that there is no prophet after him; (and Allah is Aware of all things) of your words andworks.
33|41|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Remember Allah with much remembrance)with your tongue and heart, when you engage in acts of obedience and also when you indulge intransgression.

But what do we get from Allah?" And soAllah said: (And announce) O Muhammad (unto the believers the good tidings that they will have greatbounty from Allah) an abundant reward in Paradise.
33|48|Allah then went back to the subject of the beginning of the surah, saying: (And incline not) O Muhammad(to the disbelievers) of Mecca: Abu Sufyan and his host (and the hypocrites) of Medina. (Disregard theirnoxious talk) and do not proceed to kill them, O Muhammad, (and put thy trust in Allah) rely on Allah. (Allahis sufficient as Trustee) He is sufficient to fulfil His promise to give you victory; it is also said that thismeans: He is sufficient as a Protector.

33|51|(Thou canst defer) you can leave (whom thou wilt of them) from among the daughters of your aunts fromyour father's side, and or the daughters of your uncles from your mother's side, and not marry them (andreceive unto thee whom thou wilt) and marry them, (and whomsoever thou desirest) to marry (of thosewhom thou hast set aside (temporarily), it is no sin for thee (to receive her again)) it is also said that thiscould be understood in this manner: you can abstain from whoever you will of your wives and you can go towhoever you will of your wives and there is no sin for you in abstaining from some and going to others;(that) the widening of the scope and dispensation (is better; that they may be comforted) when they knowthat this widening of scope is from Allah (and not grieve) for fear of divorce, (and may all be pleased withwhat thou givest them) of sharing your physical presence with them.

33|53|(O ye who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal) this verse was revealed concerning agroup of believers who used to enter the rooms of the Prophet (pbuh) in the morning and evening and waitfor the food to be served. They used to eat and speak with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet(pbuh) did not like this but felt shy of these believers and could not tell them to stop coming to his roomswithout permission, or ask them to leave once they were inside. But Allah forbade them from this, saying: Obelievers, do not enter the rooms of the Prophet (pbuh) without permission from the Prophet to come andeat (without waiting for the proper time) for the food to be ready, (unless permission be granted you) tocome in. (But if ye are invited, enter, and, when, your meal is ended) when you have finished eating, (thendisperse) then leave. (Linger not for conversation) with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! That) comingin, sitting down and having conversation with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) (would cause annoyance tothe Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, (and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go)) or not tocome in the first place; (but Allah is not shy of the Truth) Allah is not shy to command you to leave and notgo in his rooms without his permission. (And when ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything) andwhen you speak with them, (ask it of them) speak with them (from behind a curtain.

(And it is not for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger ofAllah) by entering his rooms without his permission and conversing with his wives, (nor that ye should evermarry his wives after him) after his death. This verse was revealed about Talhah Ibn 'Ubaydullah who had inmind to marry 'A'ishah after the death of the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! That) your open declaration and intentionto marry the Prophet's wives after his death (in Allah's sight would be an enormity) it is an enormous sinwhich merits severe punishment.

34|30|(Say) O Muhammad: (Yours is the promise of a Day which) the tryst of the Day of Judgement (ye cannotpostpone nor hasten by an hour) the appointed time.
34|31|(And those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and his host (say: We believenot in this Qur'an) which Muhammad (pbuh) recite unto us (nor in that which was before it) nor do webelieve in the Scriptures revealed before him: the Torah and the Gospel and all the other Scriptures; (but oh,if thou couldst see) O Muhammad, (when the wrong-doers) the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host (are broughtup before their Lord) restrained on the Day of Judgement, (how they cast the blame one to another) theyargue with each other and curse one another; (how those who were despised (in the earth)) how those whowere oppressed in the earth, these are the lowly among people (say unto those who were proud) too proudto accept faith: i.e. the leaders: (But for you, we should have been believers) in Muhammad (pbuh) and inthe Qur'an.
34|32|(And those who were proud) too proud to accept faith, i.e. the leader, (say unto those who were despised)those who were oppressed, i.e. the lowly people: (Did we drive you away) did we bar you (from theguidance) from faith (after it had come unto you) after it came to you from Muhammad (pbuh)? (Nay, butye were guilty) you were idolaters before the coming of Muhammad to you.
34|33|(Those who were despised) those who were oppressed, who are the lowly among people (say unto thosewho were proud) their leaders: (Nay but (it was your) scheming night and day) it is what you said to us byday and night, (when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah) when you told us to disbelieve in Muhammad(pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and set up rivals) equals and forms (unto Him. And they are filled with remorse)both the leaders and those who obeyed them (when they behold the doom; and We place carcans on thenecks of those who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. He says: their hands were tied totheir necks. (Are they requited) on the Day of Judgement (aught save what they did) and said in their stateof disbelief?
34|34|(And We sent not unto any township) to the inhabitants of any township (a warner) a warning Messenger,(but its pampered ones) its tyrants and despots (declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that which ye bringunto us) we deny what you brought us.
34|35|(And they say) to the messengers: (We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not thepunished) because of our religion in spite of all the wealth and children that we have! And this is exactlywhat the disbelievers of Mecca said to Muhammad (pbuh).
34|36|(Say) O Muhammad: (Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will) as a lure to perdition (andnarroweth it (for whom He will) out of care for him. (But most of mankind) the people of Mecca (know not)this nor believe it.
34|37|(And it is not your wealth) the abundance of your wealth, O people of Mecca, (nor your children) nor theabundance of your children (that will bring you near unto Us) that will make your rank closer to Allah, (buthe who believeth) in Allah, but it is the faith of he who believes in Allah (and doeth good) between him andhis Lord that bring one close to Allah. (As for such, theirs will be twofold reward for what they did) asbelievers, (and they will dwell secure in lofty halls) secure from death and evanescence.
34|38|(And as for those who strive against) as for those who deny (Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and theQur'an, (challenging) they will not escape Our chastisement, (they will be brought to the doom) to the Fire.
34|39|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen) as alure to perdition, (and narroweth (it) for him) out of care for him. (And whatsoever ye spend (for good)) inthe way of Allah (He replaceth it) in the life of this world with wealth and in the Hereafter with rewards.(And He is the Best of Providers) He is the Best Giver and the Best Replacer.
34|40|(And on the day when He will gather them) i.e. Banu Malih and the angels (all together, He will say Unto theangels: Did these worship you) by your command?
34|41|(They) i.e. the angels (will say: Be Thou glorified) they will exonerate Allah. (Thou art our Protector) O ourLord (from them! Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them) thinking theywere angels.
34|42|(That day) which is the Day of Judgement (ye will possess no use) no intercession (nor hurt) by drivingaway the torment (one for another) i.e. the angels and the jinn for Banu Malih. (And We shall say untothose who did wrong) those who ascribed partners to Allah: (Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used todeny) in the life of the world.
34|43|(And if Our revelations) the verses of the Qur'an (are recited unto them) unto the disbelievers of Mecca (inplain terms) expositing the lawful and the unlawful, (they say: This) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (is naught elsethan a man who would turn you away) bar you (from what your fathers used to worship) of idols; (and theysay: This) what Muhammad (pbuh) say (is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve) thedisbelievers of Mecca (say of the Truth) the Qur'an (when it reacheth them) when Muhammad (pbuh) bringsit to them: (This is naught else than mere magic) this is nothing but a manifest lie.
34|44|(And We have given them) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (no Scriptures which they study) in which theyrecite that which they claim, (nor sent We unto them, before thee) O Muhammad, (any warner) any warningMessenger.
34|45|(Those before them denied) before your people, the Quraysh, denied the messengers, (and these have notattained a tithe of that which We bestowed on them (of old)) i.e. on the disbelievers of old; it is also saidthat this means: their wealth and children have not reached even a tithe of the wealth and children thatwhich We bestowed upon the disbelievers of old; (yet they denied My messengers. How intense then wasMy abhorrence (of them)) how intense was My chastisement when they disbelieved!
34|46|(Say) to the disbelievers of Mecca, O Muhammad: (I exhort you unto one thing only) with "there is no deitysave Allah": (that ye awake, for Allah's sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect) upon whether Muhammad(pbuh) is a magician, fortune teller, a liar or madman: (There is no madness in your comrade) in yourProphet. (He) Muhammad (pbuh) (is naught else than a warner) a warning Messenger (unto you in face of aterrific doom) on the Day of Judgement if you reject faith.
34|47|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Whatever reward) or exchange (I might have asked of you is yours. Myreward is the affair of Allah only. He is Witness over all things) regarding your works.
34|48|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Lo! my Lord hurleth the Truth) He explains the Truth and commands theTruth. ((He is) the Knower of Things Hidden) He knows whatever is hidden from the servants.
34|49|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The Truth hath come) Islam has become manifest and the Muslimsnumerous, (and falsehood showeth not its face) Satan and the idols do not create (and will not return) andwill not revive the dead.
34|50|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (If I err) from the Truth and guidance, (I err only to my own loss) he says:the punishment of that is against my soul, (and if I am rightly guided) to the Truth and guidance (it isbecause of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me) that I am guided. (Lo! He is Hearer) of he who callsHim, (Nigh) in responding to whoever calls Him.
34|51|(Couldst thou but see) O Muhammad (when they are terrified) when the earth swallows them (with noescape) for anyone among them, (and are seized from near at hand) from beneath their feet the earthswallows them.
34|52|(And say) when the earth swallows them: (We (now) believe therein) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in theQur'an. Allah says: (But how can they reach (faith)) and repent (from afar off) after death,
34|53|(When they disbelieved in it) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (of yore) before they were swallowedby the earth. (They aim at the unseen) they did but surmise in the life of the world when they said there isno Paradise or hell (from afar off) after death; it is also said that this means: after death, they ask to bereturned to the life of this world by surmise.
34|54|(And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire) of returning to the life of this world, (as wasdone for people of their kind of old) and the adherents of their religion from among the disbelievers. (Lo!they were in hopeless doubt) they were in manifest doubt about the Creator of the heavens and the earth.And Allah knows best the secrets of His Book'.
35|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said upon explaining Allah's words: (Praise beto Allah): '(Praise be to Allah) He says: gratitude and favour belong to Allah, (the Creator of the heavens andthe earth, who appointeth the angels) Who created and honoured the angels and made them (messengers)i.e. He sends them with a message to His created beings; this refers to Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel, the angelof death, thunder and the Guardian angels (having wings) i.e. the angels have wings (two, three and four)wings with which to fly. (He multiplieth in creation) in the creation of angels (what He will) it is also said thatin those wings are what He wills; and it is also said: whomever He wills is in good fortune; and it is said thatthis means: whomsoever He wills has a good voice. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) of increase anddecrease.
35|2|(That which Allah openeth) that which Allah sends (unto mankind of mercy) of rain, provision or well-being(none can withholdeth it) none can stop such a mercy; (and that which He withholds none can releasethereafter) none can release it after He withholds it. (He is the Mighty) in His withholding, (the Wise) in thatwhich He sends.
35|3|(O mankind) O people of Mecca! (Remember Allah's grace towards you) in the form of rain, provision andwell-being! (Is there any creator) any god (other than Allah who provideth for you from the sky) rain (andthe earth) vegetation? (There is no God save Him) who provides you. (Whither then are ye turned) fromwhence do you lie and claim that your deities provide for you?
35|4|(And if they) the Quraysh (deny thee, (O Muhammad), messengers (of Allah) were denied before thee) theirfolks denied them just as your people are denying you. (Unto Allah all things are brought back) the endresults of all things are brought back to Allah in the Hereafter.
35|5|(O mankind) O people of Mecca! (Lo! the promise of Allah) i.e. resurrection after death (is true) it will surelyhappen. (So let not the life of the world) let not what is in the life of the world of comfort and adornment(beguile you) with regard to the obedience of Allah, (and let not the (avowed) beguiler) Satan; and it is said:the falsehoods of the life of this world (beguile you with regard to Allah) with regard to the religion of Allah.
35|6|(Lo! the devil is an enemy for you) as regards religion and obedience, (so treat him as an enemy) so fighthim and do not obey him as far as religion and obedience are concerned. (He only summoneth his faction)the adherents of his religion and obedient ones (to be owners of the flaming Fire) to be gathered with theinhabitants of hell in the Fire.
35|7|(Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (theirs will be anawful doom; and those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) and doacts of obedience between them and their Lord, (theirs will be forgiveness) their sins will be forgiven in thelife of this world (and a great reward) in Paradise.
35|8|(Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fair-seeming unto him so that he deemeth it good) right-thereference here is to Abu Jahl-like those whom We honoured with faith and obedience, i.e. Abu Bakr al-Siddiqand his fellow believers? (Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray) He sends away from His religionwhoever deserves it, (and guideth) to His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it, i.e. Abu Bakr and hisfellow believers, (so let not thy soul expire) do not kill yourself with grief (in sighings for them) in remorseabout their destruction, if they reject faith. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) in their state of disbelief ofscheming in Dar al-Nadwah and treachery in order to kill Muhammad (pbuh)!
35|9|(And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it) through rain (unto a deadland) wherein there is no plants (and revive therewith) by means of the rain (the earth after its death) afterits dryness and exposure to draught.

35|10|(Whoso desireth power) i.e. whoever desires to know to whom belongs power, might and invincibility,((should know that) all power belongeth to Allah) as belongs to Him might and invincibility. (Unto Him goodwords) the expression "there is no deity save Allah" (ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt) He acceptspious deeds through the profession of "there is no deity except Allah"; (but those who plot iniquities) thosewho associate partners with Allah; it is also said this means: those who scheme to expel, imprison orassassinate Muhammad (pbuh) in Dar al-Nadwah, (theirs will be an awful doom) as awful as can be; (andthe plotting of such (folk)) i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (will come to naught) will not succeed. It is also saidthat this verse was revealed about the people who deal with usury.
35|11|(Allah created you from dust) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then from a little fluid)the sperm drops of your fathers, (then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth) a child(or bringeth forth) gives birth after the full period of pregnancy or prematurely (save with His knowledge)save with the knowledge and command of Allah. (And no one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aughtlessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book) except that it is recorded in the Guarded Tablet. (Lo!

(Each runneth unto an appointed term) round appointed trajectories.(Such is Allah, your Lord) it is Allah, your Lord, Who does so, not the deities; (His is the Sovereignty) thestorehouses of the universe; (and those unto whom you pray) those whom you worship (instead of Him)instead of Allah (own not so much as the white spot on a date stone) they are unable to own of all that eventhe white spot on a date stone.
35|14|(If ye pray unto them) i.e. the deities (they hear not your prayer) because they are deaf and dumb, (and ifthey heard they could not grant it you) because they despise you. (On the Day of Resurrection they willdisown association with you) the deities will absolve themselves from you for associating them as partnerswith Allah and for worshipping them beside Allah. (None can Inform you) of them and their works (like HimWho is Aware) i.e. Allah.
35|15|(O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah) in relation to His forgiveness, mercy, provision andwell-being in the life of this world and to His Paradise in the Hereafter. (And Allah!

35|16|(If He will, He can be rid of you) He can destroy you, O people of Mecca (and bring (instead of you) somenew creation) who are better and more obedient than you.
35|17|(That) i.e. destroying you and bringing a new creation (is not a hard thing for Allah.
35|18|And no burdened soul can bear another's burden) i.e. with a good disposition of the soul but only insofar asit is forced to do so; it is also said that this means: no soul will be taken to task for the crime of another;and it is also said that this means: no soul will be tormented without having committed a crime, (and if oneheavy laden) with sins (crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it) none of the sins (will be lifted eventhough he (unto whom he crieth) be of kin) his father, mother, son or daughter.

35|25|(And if they) the Quraysh (deny thee) O Muhammad: (those before them also denied) those before yourown folk, the Quraysh, have also denied their messengers. (Their messengers came unto them with clearproofs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) they came to them with commands, prohibitions and signs, (and with thePsalms and the Scripture) and with the events of the Scriptures of the people of old (giving light) expositingthe lawful and the unlawful.

35|31|(As for that which We inspire in thee) as for that with which We send Gabriel to you (of the Scripture) i.e.the Qur'an, (it is the Truth confirming) Allah's divine Oneness and also agrees with some laws (that whichwas (revealed) before it) of earlier Scriptures. (Lo! Allah is indeed Observer) He is aware of those whobelieve and those who do not, (Seer of his slaves) He sees their works.
35|32|(Then) after We sent Gabriel with the Qur'an to Muhammad (pbuh) (We gave the Scripture as inheritance)We gave the honour of memorising, writing and reciting the Qur'an (unto those whom We elected of ourbondmen) by means of faith, i.e. the community of Muhammad (pbuh). (But of them are some who wrongthemselves) through committing enormities, and these will not be saved unless there is intercession in theirfavour, or unless they are forgiven or when Allah's promise is fulfilled (and of them are some who arelukewarm) some of them did good works and evil works in equal measure; these will be slightly taken totask and then be saved, (and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds) in the life of thisworld and among those brought near to the Garden of Eden in the Hereafter, (by Allah's leave) by Allah'sgiven success and beneficence.

35|34|(And they say) the inhabitants of Paradise say in Paradise: (Praise be to Allah) thanks and gratitude belongto Allah (who hath put grief) the grief of death, evanescence and the terrors of the Day of Judgement; it isalso said that this means: the grief of the risks involved in the life of this world (away from us.

Allah will say to them: (Did not We grant you a life) did We not give you, O group of disbelievers, inthe life of the world a respite (long enough for who reflected to reflect) long enough for reflection (therein)for anyone who wanted to reflect? (And the warner) Muhammad (pbuh) (came unto you) with the Qur'anand warned you against this day, but you did not believe him.

Lo! He is ever Clement) despite the claim ofthe Jews and Christians, (Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents of them.
35|42|(And they swore by Allah) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca swore by Allah before the coming of the Prophet(pbuh) (their most binding oath) by Allah, (that if a warner) a warning Messenger (came unto them theywould be more tractable) they would be swifter in responding and more guided in the religion (than any ofthe nations) than the Jews and Christians; (yet, when a warner) Muhammad (pbuh) (came unto them) withthe Qur'an (it aroused in them naught save repugnance) from it,

36|10|(Whether thou warn them) whether you warn the Banu Makhzum: Abu Jahl and his host, by means of theQur'an (or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they believe not) they do not want to believe; andthey were later killed on the Day of Badr in their state of disbelief.

37|48|(And with them) in Paradise (are those of modest gaze) wives who lower their gaze, content with theirhusbands and wish no man instead of their husband, (with lovely eyes) and beautiful faces,

37|51|(A speaker of them saith) one of the inhabitants of Paradise, Yehuda the believer, says: (Lo! I had acomrade) whose name was Abu Qutrus, who was actually his brother.

37|54|(He saith) to his brothers in Paradise: (Will ye look) in the Fire that haply you may find out about his state?
37|55|(Then looketh he and seeth him) and sees his disbelieving brother (in the depth of hell) in the middle of hell.
37|56|(He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin) you almost led me away from Religion and youwould have certainly destroyed me if I obeyed you,
37|57|(And had it not been for the favour of my Lord) Who bestowed faith upon me and protected me fromdisbelief, (I too had been of those haled forth (to doom)) I too would be tormented with you in the Fire.
37|58|Then he heard a crier saying: "O people of Paradise death is slain and from now on there is no death". Uponwhich he will say to his brothers: (Are we then not to die) after the slaying of death
37|59|(Saving our former death) after our death in the life of the world. They would say to him: "Yes, indeed!"Thereupon he will hear a crier crying: "O people of hell! The fire is now closed; none will enter it or leave it",and he will say to his brothers: (and are we not to be punished) after the Fire is closed? And their answerwill be in the affirmative.
37|60|(Lo! this is the Supreme Triumph) this is the ultimate safety; we gained Paradise and all that which is in itand were saved from hell and all that which is in it. The story of these two brothers is the same story of thetwo brothers mentioned in surah al-Kahf, one of whom was a believer, this is Yehuda, and the other anunbeliever, Abu Qutrus.
37|61|Then Allah will say to him: (For the like of this, then) eternity in Paradise and its bliss, (let the workers work)let those who hasten to do righteous works hasten to do them; it is also said that this means: for the like ofthis let those who compete to spend in the way of Allah spend their wealth; and it is also said that thismeans: for the like of this let those who strive in seeking knowledge and worship strive.
37|62|(Is this) which I have mentioned for the inhabitants of Paradise of food and drink (better as a welcome)better as food, drink and reward for the believers, (or the tree of Zaqqum) for Abu Jahl and his host?

37|64|(Lo! it is a tree that springeth) grows (in the heart of hell) in the middle of hell.
37|65|(Its crop) its fruit (is as it were the heads of devils) the heads of snakes which resemble devils. This kind ofsnakes is found near Yemen.
37|66|(And lo! They) i.e. the people of Mecca as well as all the disbelievers (verily must eat thereof) of the tree ofZaqqum, (and fill (their) bellies therewith) and fill their bellies of it.
37|67|(And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water) to go with the Zaqqum.
37|68|(And afterward, lo! their return) their destination (is surely unto hell) the middle of hell.
37|69|(They indeed found their fathers) in the life of this world (astray) from the Truth and guidance,
37|70|(But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps) they hasten to follow their religion, and do as they did.
37|71|(And verily most of the men of old) of past generations, (went astray before them) before your folk, OMuhammad.
37|72|(And verily We sent among them warners) but they disbelieved in them and, as a result, We destroyedthem.
37|73|(Then see) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence for) the requital of (those warned) of those whowere warned by the messenger, but chose to disbelieve, how we destroyed them,
37|74|Allah then made an exception, saying: (Save singled minded slaves of Allah) who are protected fromdisbelief and idolatry; and it is said that this means according to a variant reading: except those chosen forworship and the profession of Allah's divine Oneness. The latter did not disbelieve and therefore We did notdestroy them.
37|75|(And Noah verily prayed unto Us) Noah prayed against his folk, saying: (My Lord! Leave not one of thedisbelievers in the land...) [Noah, 71: 26-27], (and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer) by destroying hisfolk.
37|76|(And We saved him and his household) and all those who believed in him (from the great distress) i.e.drowning,
37|77|(And made his seed the survivors) until the Day of Judgement. Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham andYapheth. Shem is the father of the Arabs and those people surrounding them; Ham is the father theAbyssinians, Berbers and inhabitants of Sind; and Yapheth is the father of the rest of people,
37|78|(And left for him) for Noah good praise (among the later folk) who remained after him:

37|86|They replied: "we worship idols", to which Abraham said: (Is it a falsehood gods beside Allah that ye desire)do you then worship false deities?
37|87|(What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds) what do you think He will do to you if you worshipother than Him?
37|88|(And he glanced a glance at the stars) it is also said that this means: he reflected for a while,
37|89|(Then said: Lo! I feel sick!) so that they leave him alone.
37|90|(And they turned their backs and went away from him) they went to their festival and left him alone.
37|91|(Then turned he) i.e. Abraham (to their gods and said) to them: (Will ye not eat) the honey you have onyou?
37|92|When they did not answer him, he said: (What aileth you that ye speak not) why do you not answer me?
37|93|(Then he attacked them striking with his right hand) with an axe; it is also said that he fulfilled his oath.
37|94|(And (his people) came towards him, hastening) from their festival.
37|95|(He said) Abraham said to them: (Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve) with your own hands fromstones and wood,
37|96|(When Allah hath created you) and leave the worship of Allah Who created you (and what ye make) and Healso created your act of carving as well as that which you carve?
37|97|(They said: Build for him a building) a furnace (and fling him in the red hot fire.

37|102|(And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him) when his son was old enough to strive for Allah andobey Him; it is also said that this means: when his son was old enough to walk with him in the mountains,((Abraham) said) to his son Ishmael; and it is also said: to his son Isaac: (O my dear son, I have seen in adream that I must sacrifice thee) I am commanded in a dream vision to sacrifice you. (So look, whatthinkest thou) what do you say? (He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded) of sacrificingme.

37|150|(Or created We the angels females) as you claim (while they were present?

38|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said upon the interpretation of Allah's saying(Sad.): '(Sad.) He says: Sad by the Qur'an, i.e. repeat the Qur'an until you distinguish between faith anddisbelief, the prophetic wont and blameworthy innovation, truthfulness and lying, the lawful and theunlawful, good and evil; it is also said that Sad stands for barring (sadd) from the guidance, i.e. the barringof the people of Mecca from the Truth and guidance; it is also said that it stands for Abu Jahl; and it is alsosaid that it stands for truthful (sadiq) in his speech; and it is also said that Sad is one of Allah's names; andit is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore (By the renowned Qur'an) by the Qur'an whichpossesses honour and clarity of exposition; it is an honour to those who believe in it and it is a clearexposition of the people of old as well as of future generations of people. Allah swore by the Qur'an,
38|2|(Nay, but those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (are in false pride and schism) dispute andenmity, and it is for this that Allah swore.
38|3|(How many a generation) past generation (We destroyed before them) before the Quraysh, (and they criedout when it was no longer the time for escape!) the angels cried out to them upon their destruction: this isno context for attacking or fleeing; stop! And they stopped until Allah destroyed all of them. This is becausebefore this, upon fighting an enemy, they used to say: attack all together! (Manas! Manas!). Some wouldtherefore survive and others die. But when they were defeated by the enemy they used to cry: flee! Flee!(Manasa! Manasa!), and so they used to flee all together from the battlefield. These were two different signswhenever they engaged in fighting either to attack or to flee from the enemy. When Allah wished to destroythem, the angels cried out to them: this is no context for attacking or fleeing.
38|4|(And they) i.e. the Quraysh (marvel that a warner) a warning messenger (from among themselves) fromtheir own lineage (hath come unto them, and the disbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: This) meaningMuhammad (pbuh) (is a wizard) who sows dispute between people, (a charlatan) who lies about Allah.
38|5|(Maketh he the gods One God) could one God be sufficient to fulfil all our needs, as Muhammad claims? (Lo!That) which Muhammad says (is an astounding thing) is a bizarre thing.
38|6|(The chiefs among them) among the Quraysh: 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah, Ubayy Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi and Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham (go about, exhorting) Abu Jahl said to them: (Go) to your deities (and bestaunch to your gods) and persevere in the worship of your deities! (Lo! This) meaning Muhammad (pbuh)(is a thing designed) to perish; it is also said that this means: that which Muhammad is saying is designed tospread to all people of the earth.
38|7|(We have not heard of this) which Muhammad says (in later religion) in Judaism and Christianity; they meanto say: we did not hear from the Jews or Christian that God is One. (This) which Muhammad says (is naughtbut an invention) which Muhammad has invented.
38|8|(Hath the reminder been revealed unto him (alone) among us) has he been selected from among us to haveprophethood and the Scripture? (Nay, but they) the disbelievers of Mecca (are in doubt concerning Myreminder) concerning My Scripture and the prophethood of My Prophet; (nay but they have not yet tastedMy doom) they have not tasted My chastisement, this is why they lie about Me.
38|9|(Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower) He says: or do they have intheir hands prophethood and the Scriptures such that they bestow them upon whomever they wish, whenHe is the Mighty in retribution against whoever does not believe in Him, the Bestower Who has bestowedprophethood and the Scripture upon Muhammad (pbuh)?
38|10|(Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them theirs?) Or do they havepower over the heavens and the earth and over all created beings and marvels that are between theheavens and the earth? (Then let them ascend by ropes) to the gates of heavens!

38|12|(The folk of Noah before them) before your folk, O Muhammad (denied) Noah (and (so did the tribe of)'Aad) the folk of Hud deny Hud, (and Pharaoh) denied Moses (firmly planted) who had an establishedkingdom; and it is said that this means: the one who tortured using posts; this is because whenever he gotangry against someone he tortured him using four posts,
38|13|(And (the tribe of) Thamud) the folk of Salih denied Salih; (and the folk of Lot) denied Lot, (and the dwellersin the wood) the folk of Shu'ayb also denied Shu'ayb: (these were the factions) these were the disbelievers.
38|14|(Not one of them but did deny the messengers) He says: all these folks denied the messengers just as theQuraysh deny you, (therefore My doom was justified) therefore My chastisement is enjoined upon them,
38|15|(These) i.e. your folk, in case they deny you (wait for but one Shout) which is not followed by a second: thisis the blow of the Resurrection, (there will be no second thereto) there will be no respite or return.
38|16|(They say) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca said upon hearing Allah's saying (Then, as for him who is given hisrecord in his right hand, he will say: Take, read my book! ...

38|17|(Bear) O Muhammad (with what they say) in your rejection, (and remember Our bondman David) He says:mention to them the event of Our slave David, (lord of might) who had strength for our worship. (Lo! hewas ever turning in repentance (towards Allah)) he was obedient, always engaged in the worship of Allah.
38|18|(Lo! We subdued) We made subservient (the hills to hymn) with him (the praises (of their Lord) with him atnightfall and sunrise) in the morning and evening,
38|19|(And the birds assembled; all were turning unto Him) obedient to Him.
38|20|(We made his kingdom strong) with guardsmen; his royal chamber was guarded every night by 30,000 men(and gave him wisdom) prophethood (and decisive speech) and judgement; he never stumbled in his speechwhen he judged between people. In his judgement proof was required from the claimant while an oath wasrequired from the defendant.
38|21|(And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee?) Then came to you the story of the opponents of David.(How they climbed the wall into the royal chamber;
38|22|How they burst in upon David, and he) David (was afraid of them. They) i.e. the two angels who entered inon David (said: Be not afraid (We are) two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefore judgearight) justly (between us; be not unjust) do not be partial and transgress not; (and show us the fair way)show us what is right.
38|23|(Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes) meaning 99 wives (while I had one ewe) i.e. one wife; (andhe said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me in speech) this is a similitude which they struck for David inorder for him to understand what he did to Uriah.
38|24|((David) said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe) in taking your ewe (in addition to his ewes)even though he has many ewes, (and lo! many partners) and brothers (oppress one another) transgressagainst one another, (save such as believe) in Allah (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (andthey are few) those who do not transgress. And the two went out from whence they came. (And Davidguessed) he knew and was certain (that We had tried him) because of the sin he committed, (and he soughtforgiveness of his Lord) from his sin, (and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented) feelingremorse for what he did.
38|25|(So We forgave him that) sin; (and lo! he had access to Our presence) he is close in rank (and a happyjourney's end) in the Hereafter.
38|26|((And it was said unto him): O David! Lo! We have set thee as a vicegerent in the earth) We appointed youa prophet king for the Children of Israel; (therefore judge aright between mankind) judge justly betweenpeople, (and follow not desire) that as you did regarding Bathseba, the wife of Uriah, who was also David'scousin (that it beguile thee from the way of Allah) from the obedience of Allah. (Lo! those who wander fromthe way of Allah) from the obedience of Allah (have an awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day ofReckoning) because they forsake working for the Day of Reckoning.
38|27|(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them) of created beings and marvels(in vain) for nothing, without ordaining commands and prohibitions. (That is the opinion of those whodisbelieve) that is the denial of those who disbelieve in resurrection after death.

38|28|(Shall We treat those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) andperform acts of obedience between themselves and their Lord; the reference here is to 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib,Hamzah Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib and 'Ubaydah Ibn al-Harth (as those who spread corruption) as the idolaters (inthe earth) i.e. 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah, and al-Walid Ibn 'Utbah; (or shall We treat thePious) who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecent acts, i.e. 'Ali and his two fellow believers (as the wicked)as the disbelievers: 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah, and al-Walid Ibn 'Utbah? Each one of thesethree had, on the Day of Badr, a dual with 'Ali, Hamzah and 'Ubaydah, respectively; 'Ali killed al-Walid Ibn'Utbah, Hamzah killed 'Utbah Ibn Rabi'ah and 'Ubaydah killed Shaybah.
38|29|((This is) a Scripture that We have revealed unto you) We have sent with Gabriel to you, (full of blessing)wherein there is forgiveness and mercy for those who believe in it, (that they may ponder its revelations,and that men of understanding) and that those possessed of intellects among people (may reflect) takeheed.

38|33|((Then he said): Bring them back to me) bring back whatever was shown to me, (and fell to slashing (withhis sword their) legs and necks) it is also said that he began slashing their necks and legs until the sundisappeared and he missed the 'Asr prayer; this is why he did what he did.

38|64|(Lo! That) which I have mentioned of the event of the inhabitants of the Fire (is the very truth) is true: (thewrangling of the dwellers in the Fire) this is how the dwellers of the Fire argue with each other.
38|65|(Say) to the people of Mecca, O Muhammad: (I am only a warner) a warning messenger, (and there is noGod save Allah) He has no son or partner, (the One, the Absolute) Superior over His creation,

38|67|(Say) O Muhammad: (It) i.e. the Qur'an (is tremendous tidings) it is blessed and exalted and contains theevents of the people of old as well as the events of future generations of people.
38|68|(Whence you turn away) whence you disbelieve and abandon!
38|69|(I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs) i.e. of the angels, if it was not Allah Who sent me (when theydisputed) when they spoke and said: (Wilt Thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shedblood;

38|71|Then Allah explained the argument of the angels, saying: mention to them, O Muhammad (When thy Lordsaid unto the angels: lo! I am about to create a mortal out of mire) i.e. Adam,
38|72|(And when I have fashioned him) and when I have gathered his creation (and breathed into him of Myspirit) and placed in him My spirit, (then fall down before him prostrate) then prostrate before him,
38|73|(The angels fell down prostrate, every one) before Adam.
38|74|(Saving Iblis, he was scornful) he was too proud to prostrate before Adam (and became one of thedisbelievers) because of disobeying Allah's command.
38|75|(He said) Allah said to him: (O Iblis!) O wicked one! (What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before thatwhich I have created with both My hands) what prevented you from prostrating before that which I haveshaped with My hands? (Art thou too proud) to prostrate before Adam (or art thou of the high) or are you ofthose who disobey My command?
38|76|(He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou didst create of clay) and the Fireconsumes clay; this is why I did not prostrate before him.
38|77|(He said) Allah said to him: (Go forth from hence) leave the angelic form; and it is also said this means:leave the earth, (for lo! thou art outcast) you are accursed and banished from My mercy and beneficence,
38|78|(And lo! My curse) My wrath and chastisement; it is also said that Allah banished him to the isles of the seaand, hence, he goes to the land only in the form of a thief, wearing tattered clothes, and scaring people (ison you till the Day of Judgement) until the Day of Reckoning.
38|79|(He said) Iblis said: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Reprieve me) give me a respite (till the day when they areraised) from the graves. The wicked one wanted to escape the taste of death.
38|80|(He said) Allah said: (Lo! thou art of those reprieved) you are given a respite
38|81|(Until the day of the time appointed) until the first blow of the Trumpet.
38|82|(He said: Then, by Thy might) and favour, (I surely will beguile them every one) I will mislead all of themfrom Your religion and obedience,
38|83|(Save Thy single minded slaves) save those slaves who are protected from me (among them) among thechildren of Adam.
38|84|(He said) Allah said to him: (The Truth is) I am the Truth, (and the Truth I speak,
38|85|That I shall fill hell with thee) and with your offspring (and with such of them as follow thee) of the Childrenof Adam, (together) all those who obey your way.
38|86|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (I ask of you no fee) no payment or provision (for this) forbelief in Allah's divine Oneness and in the Qur'an, (and I am no impostor) and I am not inventing anything.
38|87|(Lo! It) i.e. the Qur'an (is naught else than a reminder) an admonition (for all peoples) for the jinn andhuman beings.
38|88|(And ye will come in time to know the Truth thereof) you will know the Truth of the Qur'an and that which itcontains of promises and threats after you believe; and it is also said: after death. Some came to know afterthey accepted faith: these are the believers; and some came to know after death and these are thedisbelievers. Both came to know that what Allah said in the Qur'an is the Truth'.
39|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying: (The revelation of the Scripture): '(The revelation of the Scripture is) He says: this Scripture is anaddress (from Allah, the Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Wise) in Hiscommand and decree; He commanded that none should be worshipped except Him.
39|2|(Lo! We have revealed the Scripture unto thee (Muhammad)) We have sent Gabriel to you with the Scripture(with truth) not with falsehood; (so worship Allah, making religion pure for Him (only)) making worship andthe profession of Allah's divine Oneness sincere to Him.
39|3|(Surely Pure religion is) sincerity in religion is enjoined upon people (for Allah only. And those who choose)and those who worship (protecting friends) deities: al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (beside Him) beside Allah, i.e.the disbelievers of Mecca ((say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah) near toAllah in rank and intercession. (Lo! Allah will judge between them) and the believers on the Day ofJudgement (concerning that wherein) in the matter of religion (they differ) they contravene. (Lo! Allahguideth not) to his religion (him who is a liar) about Allah, (an ingrate) and disbelieves in Allah; thereference here is to the Jews, Christians, the Banu Malih, the Magians and the Arab idolaters.
39|4|(If Allah had willed to choose a son) from among the angels or human beings as claimed the Jews,Christians and the Banu Malih, (He could have chosen what he would of that which He hath created) inParadise; and it is said: from among the angels. (Be He glorified!) Allah exonerated Himself. (He is Allah, theOne) He has no son or partner, (the Absolute) the All-Conquering over His creation.
39|5|(He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth) not in vain. (He maketh night to succeed day) Hereduces the night such that the day is longer than the night, (and He maketh day to succeed night) andprolongs the night such that the night is longer than the day, (and He constraineth the sun and the moon togive service) and He makes the sun and moon subservient to the Children of Adam, (each) i.e. the sun andthe moon, the day and night (running on for an appointed term) for an appointed time. (Is not He theMighty) He Who does this is the Mighty in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Forgiver) ofthose who believe in Him?
39|6|(He created you from one being) from the being of Adam alone, (then from that (being)) i.e. from Adam (Hemade its mate) Eve, He created her from one of Adam's shorter ribs; (and He hath provided for you of cattleeight kinds) of sheep: a male and a female; of goat: a male and a female; of camel: a male and a female; ofbovines: a male and a female. (He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation) astate after another: a sperm drop then a blood clot then a piece of flesh and then bones, (in a threefoldgloom) the darkness of the belly, the darkness of the womb and the darkness of the placenta. (Such is Allah,your Lord) Who does this. (His is the Sovereignty) which is perpetual and never ending. (There is no Godsave Him) there is no Creator or Fashioner except Him. (How then are ye turned away) How then do you lieagainst Him and ascribe partners to Him?
39|7|(If ye are thankless) if you disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, O people of Mecca, (yet Allahis Independent of you) Allah is not in need of your faith, (though He is not pleased with thanklessness forHis bondmen) though He is not pleased with disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, becausedisbelief is not His religion; (and if ye are thankful) if you believe (He is pleased therewith for you) He willaccept it from you because that is His religion. (No laden soul will bear another's load) no soul will bear thesins of another; it is also said that this means: no soul will be taken to task for the sins of another soul, foreach soul will be taken to task for its own sins; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be punishedfor no crime. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after death; (and He will tell you) on the Day ofJudgement (what ye used to do) and say in the life of this world. (Lo!

39|9|(Is he who payeth adoration) is he who obeys Allah, i.e. the Prophet (pbuh) (in the watches of the night) inthe hours of the night, (prostrate and standing) in prayer, (bewaring of the Hereafter) fearing the torment ofthe Hereafter (and hoping for the mercy of his Lord) and hoping for the Garden of his Lord, to be countedequal to Abu Jahl and his host? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Are those who know) Allah's divine Onenessand Allah's commands and prohibitions, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers (equal) in reward and acts ofobedience (with those who know not) Allah's divine Oneness or Allah's commands and prohibitions, i.e. AbuJahl and his host? (But only men of understanding) only those possessed of intellect among people (will payheed) will take admonition from the similitudes of the Qur'an.

(For those who do good) for those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness (in thisworld there is good) they will have the Garden on the Day of Judgement, (and Allah's earth) the land ofMedina (is spacious) is safe from the enemy, so travel to it; this address was before the Hijrah. (Verily thesteadfast) in the face of misfortunes (will be paid their wages) their rewards (without stint) without measureor delay.
39|11|(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca-this is when they said to him: revert to the religion of ourforefathers-: (Lo! I am commanded) in the Qur'an (to worship Allah, making religion pure for Him (only))and make my worship of Allah and faith in Allah's divine Oneness sincere to Him.
39|12|(And I am commanded) in the Qur'an (to be the first of those who surrender (unto Him)) the first of thosewho accept Islam.

41|42|(Falsehood cannot come at it) it is not contradicted by the Torah, the Gospel or by any revealed Scriptures(from before it) before its revelation (or behind it) and after there will be no Scripture which will contradictit; it is also said that this means: the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms and all the Scriptures which wererevealed before the Qur'an do not contradict it and there will be no Scripture in the future which willcontradict it and, hence, it will remain uncontradicted; and it is also said that this means: Iblis did not cometo Muhammad (pbuh) before the coming of Gabriel to him such that he added to the Qur'an, nor did hecome to him after Gabriel such that he took away from the Qur'an; and it is also said that this means: theQur'an does not contradict itself, but rather everything in it is in perfect agreement. ((It is) a revelation fromthe Wise) in His command and decree, (the Owner of Praise) the Praiseworthy in His acts.

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (For those who believe) Abu Bakrand his fellow Muslims (it) i.e. the Qur'an (is a guidance) from error (and a healing) it removes the blindnesswhich is in the hearts of people; (and as for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an,i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (there is a deafness in their ears, and it) i.e. the Qur'an (is blindness for them) aproof against them. (Such) the people of Mecca: Abu Jahl and his host (are called to from afar) it is as ifthey are called to believe in Allah's divine Oneness from high, above the sky.

Mim. 'Ayn. Sin. Qaf.): '(Ha. Mim. 'Ayn. Sin. Qaf.) this is an expression of praise by which Allah ispraising Himself. He says: the (Ha) stands for His clemency (hilmuhu), the (Mim) stand for His sovereignty(mulkuhu), the ('Ayn) stands for His knowledge ('ilmuhu), the (Sin) stands for His majesty (sana'uhu), andthe (Qaf) stands for his power (quwwatuhu) over His created beings; it is also said that the (Ha) stands forwar (harb) that will ever be, the (Mim) stand for the transformation of every sovereignty (mulk) that willever be, the ('Ayn) stands for every promise (wa'd) that will ever be made, the (Sin) stands for years (sinun)like the hard years of Joseph, and the (Qaf) stands for his slander (qadhf) that will ever be made; and it isalso said that it is an oath sworn by Allah that He will not punish eternally in the Fire anyone who sincerelysays: "there is no deity but Allah", and meets Allah believing in it.
42|3|(Thus Allah the Mighty) in retribution against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) in His commandand decree, He commands that none should be worshipped except Him; it is also said this means: theMighty in His sovereignty and dominion, the Wise in His command and decree (inspireth thee (Muhammad)as (He inspired) those before thee) of messengers; Allah says: just as We have revealed to you (Ha.

42|8|(Had Allah willed, He could have made them one community) had Allah willed He would have gathered theJews, Christians and the idolaters in one religion, the religion of Islam, (but Allah bringeth whom He will intoHis mercy) to His religion: Islam.

46|24|(Then when they beheld it a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said; Here is a cloud bringing usrain) bringing rain to our fields. Hud said to them: (Nay, but it is that which ye did seek to hasten) ofpunishment, (a wind wherein is painful torment,
46|25|Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord) by leave of its Lord. (And morning found them so that)after their destruction (naught could be seen save their dwellings) their houses. (Thus do We reward theguilty folk) the idolatrous folk.
46|26|(And verily We had empowered them with) We gave them of wealth, power and works (that where with Wehave not empowered you) that which We did not give you, O People of Mecca, (and had assigned themears) with which to hear (and eyes) with which to see (and hearts) with which to perceive; (but their earsand eyes and hearts availed them naught) from Allah's chastisement (since they denied the revelations ofAllah) since they denied Hud and Allah's Scripture; (and what they used to mock befell them) thechastisement which they used to mock befell them.
46|27|(And verily We have destroyed townships round about you) O people of Mecca, (and displayed (for them)Our revelation) and explained the revelations detailing the commands, prohibitions and the destruction ofthose whom We had destroyed, (that haply they might return) from their disbelief and repent.
46|28|(Then why did those whom they had chosen for) worshipped as (gods as a way of approach (unto Allah)) asa means to bring them closer to Allah (not help them? (Nay, but they did fail them utterly) that which theyworshipped is made void. (And (all) that was their lie, and what they used to invent) and what they used tolie about Allah.
46|29|(And when We inclined towards thee (Muhammad)) and when we directed towards you (certain) a group (ofthe jinn) nine in all, (who wished to hear the Qur'an) recited (and, when they were in its presence) andwhen they were in the presence of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in Batn Nakhl, they (said) to oneanother: (Give ear!) so that you can hear the words of the Prophet (pbuh) (and, when it was finished) whenthe Prophet (pbuh) finished his recitation and prayer, they declared their belief in Muhammad (pbuh) andthe Qur'an, and (turned back to their people, warning) they went back to their own folk as believers inMuhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an and also as warners.
46|30|(They said: O our people! Lo! we have heard a Scripture) we have heard the recitation of a Scripture,meaning the Qur'an (which hath been revealed) to Muhammad (pbuh) (after Moses, confirming that whichwas before it) confirming the message of Allah's divine Oneness and the attribute and description ofMuhammad (pbuh) found in the Torah, because they believers in Moses, (guiding unto the Truth and a rightroad) guiding to a true, established religion with which Allah is pleased, i.e. Islam.
46|31|(O our people! respond to Allah's summoner) Muhammad (pbuh) in his call for belief in Allah's divineOneness (and believe in Him. He will forgive you some of your sins) Allah will forgive you the sins youcommitted in the time of ignorance (and guard you from a painful doom) and save you from a painfultorment.
46|32|(And whoso respondeth not to Allah's summoner) Muhammad (pbuh) (he can nowise escape) Allah'spunishment (in the earth, and he hath no protecting friends) relatives to benefit him (instead of Him) besideAllah. (Such are in error manifest) such are in manifest disbelief.
46|33|(Have they not seen) do the disbelievers of Mecca not know (that Allah, Who created the heavens and theearth and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead) for the resurrection? (Aye, Heverily is Able to do all things) of giving life and inflicting death.
46|34|(And on the day when those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (are exposed to the Fire)before they eventually enter it, ((they will be asked): Is not this) chastisement (real) just? (They will say:Yea, by our Lord) it is just. (He will say: Then taste the doom for that you disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh)and the Qur'an.
46|35|(Then have patience) O Muhammad in the face of the disbelievers' harm (even as the stout of heart) asthose possessed of certainty and resolve (among the messengers (of old)) such as Noah, Abraham, Mosesand Jesus; it is also said that this means: such as those possessed of toughness and patience like Noah, Job,Zachariah and John (had patience, and seek not to hasten on the doom for them. On the day when they seethat which they are promised) of doom ((it will seem to them) as though they had tarried) in the life of theworld (but an hour of daylight. A clear message). And when the time of chastisement and destructioncomes, (Shall any be destroyed) through such a chastisement (save evil-living folk) save the disbelievers,those who had denied and barred people from the way of Allah?'
47|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Those who disbelieve): '(Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and turn(men) from the way of Allah) and prevent people from the religion and obedience of Allah-the referencehere is to those who fed the army of the disbelievers on the Day of Badr: 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons ofRabi'ah, Munbih and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj, Abu'l-Buhturi Ibn Hisham and Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham andtheir host-, (He rendereth their actions vain) He thwarts their good deeds and spending on the Day of Badr.
47|2|(And those who believe) in Allah, Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) acts of obedience,privately between them and their Lord: i.e. the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (and believe in that whichis revealed unto Muhammad) and believe in that with which Allah sent down Gabriel to Muhammad (pbuh)(and it is) i.e. the Qur'an (the Truth from their Lord. He riddeth them of their ill deeds) i.e. their sins bymeans of jihad (and improveth their state) and improves their condition, intention and works in the life of heworld; and it is said: He makes their matter manifest in Islam.
47|3|Then Allah explained why He thwarts the works of the disbelievers, saying: (That is because those whodisbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (follow falsehood) i.e. ascribing partners to Allah (andbecause those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) (follow the Truth from their Lord) i.e. the Qur'an. (ThusAllah coineth) thus Allah present (their similitudes) the similitudes of those who came before them: howAllah had destroyed them when they denied the messengers (for mankind) for the community ofMuhammad (pbuh).
47|4|Allah then encouraged the believers to fight, saying: (Now when ye meet in battle) on the Day of Badr(those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks) they smite their necks (until, when ye have routedthem) and taken them prisoners, (then making fast of bonds) keep the prisoners in captivity; (and afterwardeither grace) either release the prisoners without asking for a ransom (or ransom) or the prisoner ransomshimself (till the war lay down its burdens) until the disbelievers lay down their arms; it is also said that thismeans: until the disbelievers give up. (That (is the ordinance)) to punish whoever disbelieves in Allah. (Andif Allah willed He could have punished them (without you)) if Allah willed He could have punished thedisbelievers of Mecca through the angels; it is also said that this means: if Allah willed He could havepunished the disbelievers of Mecca without you having to fight them, (but (thus it is ordained) that He maytry some of you by means of others) but it is thus that He may test the believers with the disbelievers andthe relative with his relative. (And those who are slain in the way of Allah) and those who are killed inobedience of Allah on the Day of Badr, referring here to the prophetic Companions, (He rendereth not theiractions vain) Allah will not thwart their good deeds which were performed during jihad.
47|5|(He will guide them) He will give them success to perform righteous deeds (and improve their state) andimprove their condition and intention; it is also said that this means: He will save them in the Hereafter andimprove their state and accept their works on the Day of Judgement,
47|6|(And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them) He will indicate it for them suchthat they are guided to it, just as in the life of the world they know how to find their homes.
47|7|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (If ye help Allah, He will help you) if you helpAllah's Prophet, Muhammad (pbuh) in fighting against the enemy, Allah will help you to conquer this enemy(and will make your foothold firm) in fighting so that you do not swerve.
47|8|(And those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an: these are those who fed the army ofdisbelievers at Badr, (perdition) and abasement (is for them, and He will make their actions vain) He willthwart their good deeds and spending at Badr.
47|9|(That) thwarting (is because they are averse to) they deny (that which Allah hath revealed) that which Allahhas sent Gabriel with to Muhammad (pbuh) (therefore maketh He their action fruitless) therefore He thwartstheir good deeds and spending at Badr.
47|10|(Have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (not travelled in the land to see) to reflect upon (the nature of theconsequence for) the requital of (those who were before them? Allah wiped them out) Allah destroyed them.(And for the disbelievers) of Mecca (there will be the like thereof) the like of that torment.
47|11|(That) i.e. helping the believers (is because Allah is patron) helper (of those who believe) in Muhammad(pbuh) and the Qur'an, (and because the disbelievers) of Mecca (have no patron) have no helper.
47|12|(Lo! Allah will cause those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) anddo acts of obedience privately between themselves and their Lord (to enter Gardens beneath which)beneath its trees and houses (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow; while those who disbelieve) inMuhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an: Abu Sufyan and his host (take their comfort in this life and eat) withavidity without sparing a thought for what tomorrow holds (even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is theirhabitation) in the Hereafter.
47|13|(And how many a township) how many inhabitants of townships (stronger) physically and numerically (thanthy township (O Muhammad)) i.e. Mecca (which hath cast thee out) whose inhabitants caused you to moveto Medina, (have We destroyed) when they rejected faith, (and they had no helper) they had no one to savethem from Allah's chastisement!
47|14|(Is he who relieth on a clear proof) and a religion (from his Lord) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (like those forwhom the evil that they do is beautified) like him whose evil works are beautified, i.e. Abu Jahl (while theyfollow their own lusts) through the worship of idols?
47|15|(A similitude of the Garden) the description of Paradise (which those who keep their duty (to Allah)) whichthose who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (are promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted)unpolluted in taste or smell, (and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not) into a sour taste andpollen has not cause the offensive smell of its fat to spread, (and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers) andthis wine was not pressed with people's feet, (and rivers of clear run honey) without wax, yet it has notcome from the bellies of bees; (therein for them) for the dwellers of Paradise (is every kind of fruit, withpardon from their Lord) of the sins which they committed in the life of the world. ((Are those who enjoy allthis) like those who are immortal in the Fire) never to die therein nor leave; in reference here to Abu Jahl(and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels?
47|16|Among them) among the hypocrites (are some who give ear unto thee (Muhammad)) who listen to yourFriday sermon (till, when they go forth from your presence) until when they disperse, (they) i.e. thehypocrites (say unto those who have been given knowledge) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud: (What was that he)i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (said just now) from the pulpit? They asked this question in mockery of what theProphet (pbuh) had just said. (Those) hypocrites (are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed) such that theydo not perceive the Truth or guidance, (and they follow their own lusts) because of their secret disbelief,hypocrisy, treachery and enmity towards the Messenger of Allah (pbuh).
47|17|(While as for those who walk aright) through faith, (He addeth) by means of your sermon (to theirguidance) an insight into the matters of religion and sincerity in their intention, (and giveth them theirprotection) and inspire them their fearingness by shunning transgression and avoiding unlawful matters; it isalso said that this means: and those who are guided by the abrogating revelations, Allah increases theirguidance in the abrogated revelations and Allah, glorified and Exalted is He, honours them with the use ofboth the abrogating and the abrogated.
47|18|(Await they aught) do the disbelievers of Mecca, if they disbelieve in you, await anything (save the Hour,that it should come upon them unawares) by surprise? (And the beginnings thereof) the signs of the comingof the Hour: the splitting of the moon and the coming of the Prophet (pbuh) with the Qur'an which are of itssigns (have already come. But how, when it hath come upon them) i.e. the Hour, (can they take theirwarning) by repenting?
47|19|(So know) O Muhammad (that there is no God save Allah) there is none that harms or benefits, gives orwithholds, raises or abases except Allah; and it is also said that this means: and know there is nothing thathas the merit of "there is no deity save Allah", (and ask forgiveness for thy sin) O Muhammad, when he beatup Zayd Ibn al-Samin, the Jew (and for believing men and believing women) and seek forgiveness for thesins of the believing men and believing women. (Allah knoweth (both) your place of turmoil) your goingsand comings as well as your works in the life of the world (and your place of rest) and He knows yourdestination and abode in the Hereafter.
47|20|(And those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, the sincere ones, (say: If only a surahwere revealed) if only Gabriel would bring down a surah! They said this out of longing for the remembranceof Allah and wishing to engage in more acts of obedience. (But when a decisive surah is revealed) explainingthe lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions (and war is mentioned therein) and fighting iscommanded therein, (thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease) i.e. doubt and hypocrisy (looking atthee) upon mentioning fighting (with the look of men fainting unto death) as people who are suffering thepangs of death because of their dislike of fighting the enemies. (Therefore woe unto them!) This is a threatto them with Allah's chastisement.
47|21|(Obedience) He says: for the believers, this is an act of obedience towards Allah and His Messenger, (and acivil word) and kind word; it is also said that this means: the hypocrites' obedience of Allah and HisMessenger and kind speech to the Prophet (pbuh) is better for them than transgression, disobedience andhatred; and it is also said this means: show obedience to Allah and say kind words to Muhammad (pbuh).(Then, when the matter is determined) when the matter is resolved, Islam becomes manifest and theMuslims are numerous, (if they) i.e. the hypocrites (are loyal to Allah) through their faith and jihad (it will bewell for them) it will be better for them than transgression.
47|22|(Would ye then, if ye were given the command) would you then, O group of hypocrites, wish that if youwere given the command of this community after the Prophet (pbuh) (work corruption in the land) throughkilling, transgressions and corruption (and sever your ties of kinship) by making disbelief manifest?
47|23|(Such) the hypocrites (are they whom Allah curseth) are they whom Allah banished from any good (so thatHe deafeneth them) from the Truth and guidance (and maketh blind their eyes) such that they do not seethe Truth and guidance.
47|24|(Will they then not meditate on the Qur'an) regarding that which has been revealed about them, (or arethere locks on the hearts) or are there locks on the hearts of the hypocrites such that they do notunderstand what is revealed about them?
47|25|(Lo! those who turn back) to the religion of their forefathers, i.e. the Jews (after the guidance) Allah's divineOneness, the Qur'an and the attributes and description of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Qur'an (hath beenmanifested unto them, Satan hath seduced them) into going back to the religion of their forefathers, (andHe giveth them the rein) Allah gives them a reprieve, since He did not destroyed them immediately.
47|26|(That) reversion to their old religion (is because they) the Jews (say unto those who hate) who disbelieve insecret, i.e. the hypocrites (what Allah hath revealed) what did Allah send with Gabriel to Muhammad (pbuh):(We will obey you) we will help you, O hypocrites, (in some matters) in the matter of Muhammad by saying"there is no deity save Allah" if he has the upper hand over us; (and Allah knoweth their secret talk) Allahknows the secret talk of the Jews with the hypocrites.
47|27|(Then how (will it be with them) when the angels gather them) when the angels take away the souls of theJews, (smiting their faces and their backs) with iron skewers!
47|28|(That) smiting and punishment (will be because they followed that which angereth Allah) within Judaism,(and hated that which pleaseth Him) they denied His divine Oneness. (Therefore He hath made their actionsvain) He annulled the good actions which they performed in their practice of Judaism; and it is also said thatthe above verses were revealed about the hypocrites who moved from Medina to Mecca because theychanged their religion; and it is also said that it was revealed about the hypocrite al-Hakam Ibn Abi al-'Asand his host who deliberated on one Friday about taking the leadership of the Muslim community after theProphet (pbuh) and vowed to spread corruption. They did this while completely ignoring the Prophet whowas on the pulpit delivering his sermon. And then, in mockery, asked 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud about what theProphet (pbuh) said in his sermon.
47|29|(Or do those in whose hearts is a disease) doubt and hypocrisy (deem that Allah will not bring to light their(secret) hates) and enmity towards Allah and His Messenger; and it is also said that this means: did theythink that Allah will not bring to light their hypocrisy, enmity and hatred for the believers to know?
47|30|(And if We would, We could show them unto thee) O Muhammad by singling them out with an evil mark (sothat thou shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk)by the way they talk and try to find excuses. (And Allah knoweth your deeds) your secrets, enmity andhatred towards Allah and His Messenger.
47|31|(And verily We shall try you) through fighting (till We know) until We distinguish (those of you) O group ofhypocrites (who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and the steadfast) and those of you who are steadfast inwar, (and till We test your record) and until We bring to light your secrets, hatred, enmity and contraventionagainst Allah and His Messenger; and it is also said this means: until We bring to light your hypocrisy.
47|32|(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and turn from the way of Allah) and barpeople from the religion and obedience of Allah (and oppose the messenger) in relation to Religion (after theguidance) Allah's divine Oneness (hath been manifested unto them, they hurt Allah not a jot) they do notdiminish Allah in any way, (and He will make their actions fruitless) He annuls their good works andwhatever they have spent on the Day of Badr; this refers to those who fed the army of the disbelievers onthe Day of Badr.
47|33|(O ye who believe) openly! (Obey Allah and obey the messenger) in private, (and render not your actionsvain) through hypocrisy, hatred, enmity and opposition of the Messenger; it is also said that this verse wasrevealed about true believers. Allah says to them: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an,obey Allah in that which He commands you of obligations and spending, and obey also the Messenger inthat which he commands you of the Sunnah, conquest and Jihad; and do not annul your works throughostentation and seeking fame.
47|34|(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; this refers to those who sponsored thefeeding of the army of disbelievers on the Day of Badr (and turn from the way of Allah) and turn awaypeople from the religion and obedience of Allah (and then die) or killed as (disbelievers) in Allah and HisMessenger, (Allah surely will not pardon them) because they are disbelievers in Allah and His Messenger.
47|35|(So do not falter) do not weaken, O believer, upon fighting the disbelievers (and cry out for peace) and it issaid this means: for Islam before fighting (when you (will be) the uppermost) when you are the victoriousand the ultimate consequence will be in your favour, (and Allah is with you) He helps you to defeat yourenemy, (and He will not grudge (the reward of) your actions) and He will not diminish the works in whichyou engage during jihad.
47|36|(The life of the world) that which is in the life of the world (is but a sport) vain sport (and a pastime) andexultation which does not last. (And if ye believe) and if you are steadfast in your faith in Allah and HisMessenger (and ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, (He will give you your wages) He willgive you the reward of your works, (and will not ask of you your worldly wealth) all your worldly wealth togive to charity.
47|37|(If He should ask it) if He should ask all of it (of you) to give to charity (and importune you) and burden you,(ye would hoard it) you would refrain from giving alms in obedience of Allah, (and He would bring to lightyour (secret) hates) and He would bring to light your miserliness.
47|38|(Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, (yet among you thereare some who hoard) there are some who refrain from spending in obedience of Allah. (And as for him whohoardeth) and refrains from spending in obedience of Allah, (he hoardeth only from his soul) he is miserlyonly insofar as reward for, and honour of, his soul are concerned. (And Allah is the Rich) He has no need foryour wealth and charity, (and ye are the poor) for Allah's mercy, Paradise and forgiveness. (And if ye turnaway) from obeying Allah and obeying His Messenger regarding that which He commands you of spending(He will exchange you for some other folk) He will make you perish and replace you with others who arebetter and more obedient than you, (and they will not be the likes of you) in relation to transgression anddisobedience; rather, they will be better and more obedient than you. It is also said that from Allah's saying(O ye who believe) to the end were revealed about the hypocrites of Asad and Ghatafan, and so Allahreplaced them with Juhaynah and Muzaynah who were better and more obedient to Allah'.
48|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (Lo!We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory): '(Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signalvictory) without fighting, and the treaty of al-Hudaybiyyah is part of this victory, except that in al-Hudaybiyyah they threw stones at each other; it is also said that this means: We have enjoined for you amanifest judgement; We honoured you with Islam and prophethood and commanded you to call people tothem,
48|2|(That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past) before the revelation came to you (and that whichis to come) and that which is after the revelation and until you die, (and may perfect His favour unto thee)through prophethood, Islam and forgiveness, (and may guide thee on a right path) and may hold you firmon an established way with which He is pleased, i.e. Islam,
48|3|(And that Allah may help you) against your enemy (with strong help) whereby you suffer no humiliation.
48|4|(He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance) tranquillity (into the hearts of the believers) into the heartsof true believers on the day of al-Hudaybiyyah (that they might add faith) that they might add certainty,belief and knowledge (unto their faith) in Allah and His Messenger. (Allah's are the hosts of the heavens) theangels (and the earth) the believers and He sets them on whoever He will among His enemies, (and Allah isever Knower) of what He has done to you: victory, forgiveness, guidance, help and sending down tranquillityinto the hearts of the believers, (Wise) regarding that which He has done with you.
48|5|When the true believers heard of the honour that Allah had bestowed upon His Prophet, they said:"Congratulations, O Messenger of Allah, for what Allah has given you of victory, forgiveness and honour; butwhat do we have with Allah?" So Allah said: (That He may bring the believing men) the true believing men(and the believing women) and true believing women (into Gardens beneath which) beneath whose trees,houses and rooms (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein they will abide) they will abide inthe Garden and will never die or leave it, (and may remit from them their evil deeds) which they committedin the life of the world. (That) which I have mentioned which the believers will have, (in the sight of Allah, isthe Supreme Triumph) is the greatest safety: they gain Paradise and avoid the Fire and all that which is in it.
48|6|When 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul heard of the honour Allah had bestowed upon the believers, he wentand said to the Prophet (pbuh): "O Messenger of Allah! By Allah, we are just like them, so what do we get?"Allah said: (And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men andthe idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning Allah) that He will not help His Messengeragainst the hypocrites. (For them is the evil turn of fortune) and an evil consequence, (and Allah is wrothagainst them and hath cursed them) He banished them from all good, (and hath made ready for them) inthe Hereafter (hell, a hapless journey's end) what an evil destination they will head for in the Hereafter.
48|7|(Allah's are the hosts of the heavens) the angels (and the earth) the believers; He gives help to whomeverHe will, (and Allah is ever Mighty) in retribution against the disbelievers and hypocrites, (Wise) in bestowinghonour on true believers because of their faith; and it is also said that this means: Allah is ever Mighty in Hisdominion and sovereignty, Wise in His command, decree and help of His Prophet against his enemies.
48|8|(Lo! We have sent thee) O Muhammad (as a witness) over your community that you had delivered themessage to them (and a bearer of good tidings) the Garden for the believers (and a warner) to thedisbelievers from the Fire,
48|9|(That ye (mankind) may believe in Allah and His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (and may honour Him)defend him with the sword against his enemies, (and may revere Him, and may glorify Him) and pray toAllah (at early dawn and at the close of day) in the morning and evening.
48|10|Then He mentioned the pact of Ridwan at al-Hudaybiyyah which took place under a tree, the Samurah tree;those present at this pact were about 1500 people, and swore allegiance to the Prophet of Allah which,among others, entailed giving counsel, help and not running away [in war]. Allah said: (Lo! those who swearallegiance unto thee (Muhammad)) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah, (swear allegiance only unto Allah) it is asif they swear allegiance to Allah. (The Hand of Allah) in terms of reward and help (is above their hands) inrelation to truthfulness, fulfilment and completion. (So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to hissoul's hurt) the punishment of this breaking is against his soul; (while whosoever keepeth his covenant withAllah) and remain truthful and loyal, (on him will He bestow immense reward) on him Allah bestowsabundant reward in Paradise. None of those who swore allegiance broke his oath, because they were allsincere and died honouring the allegiance of Ridwan. That is to say to the exception of one man named JaddIbn Qays, a hypocrite, who hid on that day behind his camel and did not join in when the swearing ofallegiance took place. Allah made him die in his state of hypocrisy.
48|11|(Those of the wandering Arabs) from Banu Ghifar, Aslam, Ashja', Dayl and some people from Muzaynah andJuhaynah (who were left behind) at the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah (will tell thee: Our possessions and ourhouseholds occupied us) we were afraid that our households would be ruined if we went out with you, andthis is why we stayed behind, (so ask forgiveness for us) O Messenger of Allah, for failing to accompany youto al-Hudaybiyyah! (They speak with their tongues) they ask with their tongue-i.e. forgiveness-(that which isnot in their hearts) without really feeling the need for it, whether you ask forgiveness for them or not. (Say)to them, O Muhammad: (Who can avail you aught against Allah) who can do anything about Allah's torment,(if he intend you hurt) killing and defeat (or intend you profit) victory, booty and well-being? (Nay, but Allahis ever Aware of what ye do) Allah is aware of your failure to join the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah.
48|12|(Nay, but ye deemed) O hypocrites (that the messenger and the believers would never return to their ownfolk) from al-Hudaybiyyah to Medina, (and that was made fair-seeming in your hearts) and you were soconvinced of this that you stayed behind, (and ye did think an evil thought) and you thought that Allah willnot help His Prophet, (and ye were worthless folk) and you were ruined folk, with unsound and hardenedhearts.
48|13|(And as for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger) as for him who is not true in his faith in Allahand His Messenger. (Lo! We have prepared a flame for disbelievers) for disbelievers who disbelieve openlyor secretly.
48|14|(And Allah's is the Sovereignty) the stores (of the heavens) rain (and the earth) vegetation. (He forgivethwhom He will) of the believers for committing enormities, out of favour, (and punisheth whom He will) forcommitting minor sins, in justice; it is also said that this means: He honours whom He will with faith andrepentance such that He forgives him and makes die whom He will in a state of disbelief and hypocrisy andthen punishes him for it; and it is also said that this means: He forgives whoever deserves to be forgivenand punishes whoever deserves to be punished. (And Allah is ever Forgiving) He always forgives whoeverrepents of enormous and minor sins, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant.
48|15|(Those who were left behind) at the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah, i.e. Banu Ghifar, Aslam, Ashja' and somepeople from Muzaynah and Juhaynah (will say, when ye set forth to capture booty) the booty of Khaybar:(Let us go with you) to Khaybar. (They fain would change the verdict of Allah) when he said to His Prophetnot to let them accompany him to any other conquest after failing to join the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah.(Say) to Banu 'Amir, Dayl, Aslam, Ashja', and a group from Muzaynah and Juhaynah: (Ye shall not go withus) to Khaybar except as volunteers but you will not have a share of the booty. (Thus) just as we told you(hath Allah said beforehand) in surah Repentance (say unto them: Ye shall never more go out with me norfight with me against a foe...). Upon hearing this, the hypocrites said to the believers: Allah has notcommanded you this, it is rather because you are resentfully envious of us for sharing the booty with you.So Allah said: (Then they will say: Ye are envious of us) regarding the booty. (Nay, but they understand not)the command of Allah, (save a little) neither much nor a little.
48|16|(Say) O Muhammad (unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind) Dayl, Ashja', and a group ofpeople from both Muzaynah and Juhaynah: (Ye will be called) after the Prophet (pbuh) (against a folk) tofight a folk (of mighty prowess) who are tough in fighting; the reference here is to the people of al-Yamamah, Banu Hanifah, the folk of Musaylimah the liar, (to fight them) because of religion (until theysurrender; and if ye obey) and agree to fight and make your profession of Allah's divine Oneness pure,(Allah will give you a fair reward) in the Garden; (but if ye turn away) from Allah's divine Oneness,repentance, sincerity and acceptance to fight against Musaylimah the liar (as ye did turn away before) at theconquest of al-Hudaybiyyah, (He will punish you with a painful doom).
48|17|Then the people who had infirmities and chronic illnesses came to the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and said:"O Messenger of Allah! Allah has threatened to punish whoever stays behind and does not take part infighting with a painful doom. How can we go out in military expedition when we are physically unable to doso?" And so Allah said: (There is no blame for the blind) if he does not go out in military conquests, (nor isthere blame for the lame) if he does not go out in military conquests, (nor is there blame for the sick (thatthey go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger) openly and privately and answershim by going out to fight the enemy, (He will make him enter Gardens beneath which) beneath whosehouses, rooms and trees (rivers) of wine, water, honey, and milk (flow; and whoso turneth back) from theobedience of Allah and His Messenger and refuses to comply, (him will He punish with a painful doom).
48|18|Allah then mentioned His pleasure with those who swore allegiance at the pledge of Ridwan, saying: (Allahwas well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree) when theyswore allegiance to you at al-Hudaybiyyah under the Samurah tree; they were about 1,500 men who sworeallegiance to assist and defend the Prophet and to remain in fighting, if need be, till death, (and He knewwhat was in their hearts) of truthfulness and loyalty, (and He) Allah Exalted is He (sent down peace ofreassurance) tranquillity (on them) and removed zealotry from them, (and hath rewarded them) after this(with a near victory) the conquest of Khaybar, soon after that;
48|19|(And much booty that they will capture) the booty of Khaybar. (Allah is ever Mighty) in retribution againstHis foes, (Wise) in giving help, conquest and booty to the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions.
48|20|(Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture) this is the booty of Persia which they had notcaptured yet but would capture a few years later, (and hath given you this) i.e. the booty of Khaybar (inadvance, and hath withheld men's hands from you) from fighting you; referring here to Asad and Ghatafanwho were allies of Khaybar, (that it) the conquest of Khaybar (may be a token) a lesson and sign (for thebelievers) this is because the believers were about 8,000 in number while Khaybar were about 70,000, (andthat He may guide you on a right path) and that He may hold you firm on an established religion with whichHe is pleased.
48|21|(And other (gain)) and other booty, (which ye have not been able to achieve) yet, (Allah will compass it)Allah knows that it will happen, this is the booty Persia. (Allah is Able to do all things) of conquest, victoryand capturing booty.
48|22|(And if those who disbelieve) Asad, Ghatafan along with Khaybar (join battle with you they will take to flight)defeated, (and afterward they will find no protecting friend) to prevent you from killing them (nor helper)who can prevent their killing and defeat.
48|23|(It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime) regarding past nations that they were exposed tokilling and defeat when their rebelled against the prophets of Allah. (Thou wilt not find for the law of Allah)you will not find for the law of Allah of punishing those who rebel against the prophets (aught of power tochange) any change.
48|24|(And He it is Who hath withheld men's hands) the hands of the people of Mecca (from you) from fightingyou, (and hath withheld your hands from them) from fighting them, (in the valley of Mecca) in the middle ofMecca except that they threw stones at each other, (after He had made you victors over them) for theCompanions of the Prophet (pbuh) overwhelmed with stone throwing until they entered Mecca. (Allah isSeer of what ye do) of throwing stones and other things as well.
48|25|(These it was who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, i.e. the people of Mecca (anddebarred you from the Inviolable Place of Worship) and prevented you from the Inviolable Place of Worshipon the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, (and debarred the offering from reaching its goal) and prevented yoursacrifices from reaching the place where they were to be sacrificed. (And if it had not been for believingmen) al-Walid and Salamah the sons of Hisham, 'Ayyash Ibn Rabi'ah and Abu Jandal Ibn Suhayl Ibn 'Amr(and believing women) in Mecca, (whom ye know not lest ye should tread them under foot) lest you shouldkill (and thus incur) because of killing (guilt for them) blood money and the sin of killing them;(unknowingly) without knowing that they were believers. if it were not for that, Allah would have set you onthem to kill them; (that Allah might bring into His mercy) that Allah may honour with His religion (whom Hewill) whoever deserves it. (If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated) if the believershad moved out from among the disbelievers (We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved) thedisbelievers of Mecca (with painful punishment) with your swords.
48|26|(When those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry ofthe Age of Ignorance) by preventing the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and his Companions from the House,(then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance) His tranquillity (upon His messenger and upon thebelievers) and removed zealotry from them (and imposed on them) and inspired them with (the word of selfrestraint) "there is no deity save Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah", (for they were worthy ofit) they were worthy of "there is no deity save Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah", as it was inAllah's beginninglessly eternal knowledge (and meet for it) in the life of this world. (And Allah is Aware of allthings) regarding honouring the believers.
48|27|(Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth) truly. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) hadtold his Companions: (Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure) from theenemy, ((having your hair) shaven and cut, not fearing) the enemy; and Allah did fulfil what the Prophet(pbuh) had said to his Companions. (But He knoweth that which ye know not) Allah had known that what hepromised was not to take place in that year but in the following year, while you did not know this, (and hathgiven you a near victory beforehand) i.e. the conquest of Khaybar before the fulfilment of this vision.
48|28|(He it is Who hath sent His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (with the guidance) with the profession of Allah'sdivine Oneness; and it is also said this means: with the Qur'an (and the religion of truth) the testificationthat there is no deity save Allah and that Muhammad is His Slave and Messenger, (that He may cause it toprevail over all religion) such that the Hour will not come until there is none but a Muslim or someone who isin a peace treaty with him. (And Allah sufficeth as a witness) there is no deity except Allah.
48|29|(Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah) and this without the witness of Suhayl Ibn 'Amr. (And those withhim) i.e. Abu Bakr, the first who believed in him and called the disbelievers with him to the religion of Allah(are hard against the disbelievers) this refers to 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who was tough with the enemies ofAllah, strong in the religion of Allah and a defender of Allah's Messenger (and merciful among themselves)and dutiful towards each other; this refers to 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan who was very dutiful and merciful towardsthe Muslims, and spent much of his money on them. (Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing) in prayer(and falling prostrate (in worship)) this refers to 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib who abundantly bowed and prostrated inprayer, (seeking bounty) reward (from Allah and (His) acceptance) acceptance of their Lord through jihad;this refers to Talhah and al-Zubayr who were very hard on, and tough with, the disbelievers. (The mark ofthem is on their foreheads from) the sign of their staying awake is on their faces from (the traces ofprostration) from repeated prostration at night; this refers to Salman al-Farisi, Bilal, Suhayb and their fellowbelievers. (Such is their likeness) their description (in the Torah and their likeness) and their description in(in the Gospel like as sown corn) this is the Prophet (pbuh) (that) Allah (sendeth forth its shoot) i.e. AbuBakr, the first to believe in him and the first to face the enemies of Allah (and strengtheneth it) and assistshim; this is 'Umar who assisted the Prophet (pbuh) with his sword against the enemies of Allah (and risethfirm) He became strong with the wealth of 'Uthman which he used in jihad in the way of Allah (upon itsstalk) and spread his message among Quraysh through 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, (delighting the sowers) theProphet (pbuh) was pleased with Talhah and al-Zubayr (that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sightof) them) by means of Talhah and al-Zubayr. It is also said that from Allah's saying (Muhammad is theMessenger of Allah...) up to here was revealed in praise of those who took part in the swearing of allegianceat Ridwan and the sincere, obedient prophetic Companions in general. (Allah hath promised, unto such ofthem as believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts of obedience inprivate between themselves and their Lord, (forgiveness) of their sins in this world and in the Hereafter (andimmense reward) and abundant reward in the Garden'.
49|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah): '(O ye who believe! Be not forward inthe presence of Allah) do not start with any word or action until the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) commands orprohibits you first; it is also said that this means: do not start immolating your sacrifices on the day ofimmolation (and His messenger) until you receive Allah's command and the command of His Messenger; it isalso said that this means: do not oppose the Messenger; and it is said this means: do not contravene theBook of Allah or the practice of His Messenger, (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in relation to sayingor doing anything without the command of Allah or of His Messenger, and do not oppose the Book of Allahor the practice of His Messenger. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your works. This wasrevealed about three prophetic Companions who killed two men from Banu Salim when the Muslims had apeace treaty with them, without being commanded to do so by Allah or by His Messenger. Allah, glorifiedand Exalted is He, forbade them from engaging in any matter without a command from Allah or HisMessenger.
49|2|(O ye who believe!) This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who raised his voice in thepresence of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) upon the visit of the delegation of Banu Tamim. And so Allahforbade him from doing so. Allah said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; in referenceto Thabit, (Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, norinsist in talking when the Prophet (pbuh) is talking, (nor shout when speaking to him) nor call him by hisfirst name (as ye shout one to another) as you would do with one another; rather you should reverence andhonour him and address him by: "O Prophet of Allah" or "O Messenger of Allah" or "O Abu'l-Qasim", (lestyour works be rendered vain while ye perceive not) lest your good works be nullified for failing to observepropriety and reverence towards the Prophet (pbuh) while not knowing that your works are nullified.
49|3|(Lo! they who subdue their voices) this also was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas after he wasprohibited from raising his voice (in the presence of the Messenger of Allah) Allah bless him and give himpeace, praising him for lowering his voice in the presence of the Prophet (pbuh) saying: they who subduetheir voice in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven) thoseare they whose hearts Allah has cleansed and purified (unto righteousness) from sin; it is also said that thismeans: those are they whose hearts Allah has made sincere to the profession of Allah's divine Oneness.(Theirs will be forgiveness) of their sins in the life of the world (and immense reward) and abundant rewardin the Garden.
49|4|(Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartment) this was revealed about a folk from Banu'Anbar, from the Khuza'ah tribe to whom the Prophet (pbuh) sent a military expedition under the leadershipof 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari. When they heard of the advance of this expedition towards them, they fled,leaving behind their wives and children and properties. Their wives and children were taken captive andbrought to the Prophet (pbuh). The men who fled went to Medina to ransom their wives and children andentered the city at the time of the siesta. They called: "O Muhammad, come out to see us", while he wassleeping. Allah censured them for doing so, saying: (Lo! those who call you from behind the privateapartment most of them) all of them (have no sense) do not understand Allah's command or divine Onenessnor the reverence due to Allah's Messenger.
49|5|(And if they) the Banu 'Anbar (had patience till thou camest forth unto them) for the prayer, (it had beenbetter for them) he would have freed all their wives and children; instead he freed half of them and agreedthe ransom of the remaining half. (And Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents of them, (Merciful) inthat He did not hasten His punishment on them.
49|6|(O ye who believe! If an evil-liver) this was revealed about al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah Ibn Ma'it who was sent bythe Prophet (pbuh) to Banu'l-Mustaliq to collect their alms; instead he came back claiming that they wantedto kill him. The Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions were about to set forth to conquer them but Allahforbade them from doing so, saying: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an if a hypocrite,al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah, (bring you tidings) brings you news about Banu'l-Mustaliq, (verify it) check whether thenews are true or false, (lest ye smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did) regretkilling them.
49|7|(And know) O believers (that the Messenger of Allah is among you) is with you. (If he were to obey you inmuch of the government) in much of what you request, (ye would surely be in trouble) you would surly sin;(but Allah hath endeared the faith) the belief in Allah and His Messenger (to you and hath beautified it inyour hearts) and made it seem good in your hearts, (and hath made disbelief) denial of Allah and HisMessenger (and lewdness) hypocrisy (and rebellion) and all transgressions (hateful unto you. Such) thosewho have such traits (are they who are rightly guided.
49|8|(It is) a bounty and a grace from Allah) that He honoured the believers; (and Allah is Knower) of honouringthe believers, (Wise) in placing in their hearts love of faith and hatred of disbelief, lewdness and rebellion.
49|9|(And if two parties of believers fall to fighting) this was revealed about the hypocrite 'Abdullah Ibn UbayyIbn Salul and his host and 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah, a true believer, and his companions; these two partiesfell to fighting after an exchange of words, and so Allah forbade them from fighting each other andcommanded them to make up, saying, (And if two parties of believers fall to fighting then make peacebetween them) by referring to the Book of Allah. (And if one party of them) the party of 'Abdullah Ibn UbayyIbn Salul (doeth wrong to) persists and transgresses against (the other) the party of 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahahal-Ansari, and refuses to make peace by referring the matter to the Qur'an, (fight ye that which doeth wrongtill it return unto the ordinance of Allah) until it accepts to make peace by referring to the ordinances of theQur'an; (then, if it return) if it accepts to make peace by referring the matter to the Book of Allah, (makepeace between them justly, and act equitably) towards both parties. (Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) Allahloves those who judge justly by the Book of Allah, and act upon it.
49|10|(The believers are naught else than brothers) in religion. (Therefore make peace between your brethren) bymeans of the Book of Allah (and observe your duty to Allah) and fear Allah regarding that which Hecommands you regarding making peace (that haply ye may obtain mercy) and not be punished.
49|11|(O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk) this was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whomentioned a man of the Helpers with something bad; he mentioned the man's mother about whom he usedto taunted in the pre-Islamic period, but Allah forbade him from saying ill things about fellow believers,saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; referring here specifically to Thabit! (Letnot a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are)) in the sight of Allah and also better in the sharethey have with Him, (nor let women (deride) women) this was revealed about two of the wives of theProphet (pbuh) who derided Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet, and Allah forbade them from doing so(who may be better than they are) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him;(neither defame one another) do not defame your believing brothers nor backbite against each other, (norinsult one another by nicknames) which were used in the pre-Islamic period. (Bad is the name of lewdness)it is bad to call your brother: "O Jew", "O Christian", "O Magian" (after faith) after having accepted faith andturned his back on all that. (And whoso turneth not in repentance) from calling his brothers with such namesand nicknames after having accepted faith, (such are evil-doers) such are those who harm themselves withpunishment. This was revealed about Abu Burdah Ibn Malik al-Ansari and 'Abdullah Ibn Hadrad al-Aslamiwho had a dispute and Allah forbade them from doing so.
49|12|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Shun much suspicion) this was revealed abouttwo Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who backbit Salman al-Farisi and also thought ill of Usamah, theServant of Allah's Messenger (pbuh). They spied on him to see whether Usamah did really have what theProphet (pbuh) asked him to give to them. Allah therefore forbade them from having a bad opinion aboutothers, as well as from suspicion and spying; and so He said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) andthe Qur'an, shun much suspicion about your brother's ins and outs (for lo! some suspicion is a crime) forsome ill thoughts and what you hide are sins; this is what the two men thought of Usamah. (And spy not)and do not scrutinise the faults of your brother, nor reveal that which Allah has concealed about him; andthis is exactly what the two men did, (neither backbite one another) the two backbit Salman. (Would one ofyou love to eat the flesh of his dead brother) unlawfully without any necessity? (Ye abhor that (so abhor theother)) you deem eating the flesh of a carrion unlawful unless it is out of necessity, consider backbiting yourbrother likewise! (And keep your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding backbiting anyone. (Lo! Allah isRelenting) Allah forgives whoever repents of backbiting, (Merciful) towards whoever die repentant.
49|13|(O mankind!) This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who said to a man: "You are the sonof so-and-so" in reference to his mother; and it is also said that it was revealed about Bilal the muezzin ofthe Prophet (pbuh). When Bilal gave the call to prayer in Mecca after its conquest, a group of men fromQuraysh, among whom were Sahl Ibn 'Amr, al-Harth Ibn Hisham and Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, said: "Did Allahand His Messenger not find anyone to call to prayer except this raven". In response, Allah said: (Lo! Wehave created you male and female) from Adam and Eve, (and have made you nations and tribes that yemay know one another. Lo! the noblest of you) in the Hereafter, (in the sight of Allah) on the Day ofJudgement, (is the best in conduct) in the life of the world; which in this case is Bilal. (Lo! Allah is Knower)of your status and lineage, (Aware) of your works and standing in His sight.
49|14|(The wandering Arabs say: We believe) this was revealed about Banu Asad who had suffered a very hardyear and consequently joined Islam and moved with all their families and children to Medina to benefit fromthe Prophet's donations. But their presence in Medina caused a rise in the price of foodstuffs and the streetsof Medina became full of their impurities. In fact, these people were hypocrites who kept reiterating: "OMessenger of Allah! We are true believers, so do feed us and be generous with us". When Allah mentionedtheir claim, the wandering Arabs of Banu Asad said: "We are genuine in our faith in Allah and HisMessenger". But Allah said: (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Ye believe not) you are not genuine in your faithin Allah and His Messenger, (but rather say "We submit") we submit so that we may be spared from thesword and captivity, (for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts) for love and sincerity of faith havenot entered your hearts. (Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger) inwardly as you obey him outwardly andrepent of inward disbelief and hypocrisy, (He will not withhold from you aught of (the reward of) yourdeeds) He will not diminish the reward of your works. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repent ofyou, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant.
49|15|Allah then explained the traits of those who are true in their faith, saying: (The (true) believers) who aresincere in their faith (are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger and afterward doubt not) intheir faith, (but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah) in obedience to Allah. (Such arethe sincere) who are true in their faith and striving.
49|16|(Say) to Banu Asad, O Muhammad: (Would ye teach) would you inform Allah (Allah your religion) aboutwhether you are sincere or insincere in your religion, (when Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and allthat is in the earth) when He knows what is in the hearts of all those who are in the heavens and the earth,(and Allah is Aware of all things) of the secrets of the dwellers of the heavens and the earth?
49|17|(They make it favour unto thee) Muhammad (that they have surrendered (unto Him)) this is their claim: "OMessenger of Allah, feed us and be generous to us, for we have become Muslim". (Say) to them, OMuhammad: (Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; nay, but Allah doth confer a favour on you,inasmuch as He hath led you) that He has called you (to the Faith) to accept the Faith, (if ye are earnest) inyour claim that you are true believers; but you are not.
49|18|(Lo! Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth) He knows the future events that will takeplace in the heavens and the earth. (And Allah is Seer of what ye do) O hypocrites, in your state ofhypocrisy and He also knows your punishment if you do not repent'.
50|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying(Qaf.): '(Qaf.) He says: it is an azure mountain overlooking this world, and the colour of the sky takes fromit; Allah swore by it, (By the glorious Qur'an) and He swore by the glorious, noble Qur'an,
50|2|(Nay, but they marvel) i.e. the Quraysh; and it is because they marvelled that Allah made this oath: theymarvelled when they were told they will be resurrected after death; He said: in fact the Quraysh, amongwhom Ubayy and Umayyah the sons of Khalaf, Munbih and Nabih the son of Hajjaj, marvelled (that awarner) a warning messenger (of their own) from their own lineage (hath come unto them; and thedisbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca: Ubayy, Umayyah, Munbih and Nabih (say: This) which Muhammad(pbuh) says, i.e. that they will be resurrected after death, (is a strange thing) for he says:
50|3|(When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again)? That) which Muhammadclaims (would be a far return!) will never happen; thus denying resurrection after death.
50|4|Allah, Exalted is He, said: (We know that which the earth taketh of them) We know that which the earthdevours of their flesh after they die and that which it leaves, (and with Us is a recording Book) and with Usis a Book preserved from Satan.

50|5|(Nay, but they) the Quraysh (have denied the Truth) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (when it came untothem) this is the second clause of the oath, i.e. by the noble and glorious Qur'an, Muhammad (pbuh) hasbrought them the Qur'an, (therefore they are now in troubled case) they are in error; it is also said that thismeans: they are confused; and it is also said this means: they are in disagreement, some of them believewhile others do not.
50|6|(Have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (not then observed the sky above them) above their heads, (howWe have constructed it) without pillars (and beautified it) and beautified it with stars, (and how there are norifts therein) and how there are no rifts, cracks or defects therein?
50|7|(And the earth have We spread out) over water, (and have flung firm hills) firm mountains so that it doesnot sway (therein) on the earth, (and have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon) and have caused ofevery kind of seemly appearance to grow thereon,

50|12|(The folk of Noah denied) denied Noah (before them) before your folk, O Muhammad, (and (so did) thedwellers at al-Rass) al-Rass is a well close to al-Yamamah; the dwellers of al-Rass are the people of Shu'aybwho denied Shu'ayb (and (the tribe of) Thamud) the people of Salih,

We are the messengers of your Lord (and gave him tidings of (the birth of) a wise son) a son whois wise in his childhood, great when he grows older: this is Isaac.

53|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (By the Najm when it setteth): '(By the Najm when it setteth) He says: Allah swears by the Qur'anwhen Gabriel takes it down to Muhammad in instalments (nujuman): one, two, three or four verses at atime. There was a 20 years interval between the first and last verses. When this verse was revealed, 'UtbahIbn Abi Lahab heard that the Prophet (pbuh) swore by the revelation of the Qur'an in instalment and so hesaid: "Tell Muhammad that I disbelieve in the instalments of the Qur'an". When the Prophet (pbuh) wasinformed of this, he prayed: "O Allah! Set on him one of Your wild beasts". Later, Allah set on him a lionnear Harran that snatched him from among his friends and took him to a place nearby. It tore him apartfrom head to foot but did not eat him because of his impurity, just as the Prophet (pbuh) had prayed againsthim. It is also said here Allah swore by the stars when they set,
53|2|(Your comrade erreth not) this is the reason why Allah made the above oath: your Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) did not lie about what he said to you, (nor is deceived) he is not wrong nor did he err in what hesaid;

53|5|(Which one of mighty powers hath taught him) Gabriel taught him,
53|6|(One vigorous) one strong; it is also said this means: one mighty, for his strength was such that he put hishand under the townships of Lot and pulled them out, raised them to the sky and threw them upside downto the ground. His strength was also such that he seized the sides of the gate of Antioch and cried one crythat killed all the living creatures in it. It is also said that his strength was such that he spread one of hisfeathers on a hill in Jerusalem and struck with it Iblis who was at the farthest corner of India; (and he grewclear to view) Gabriel appeared in the form in which Allah created it him; and it is also said: he appeared ina beautiful form.
53|7|(When he was on the uppermost horizon) at the setting place of the sun; and it is said: at the seventhheaven.
53|8|(Then he drew nigh) Gabriel drew near Muhammad (pbuh); and it is said: Muhammad (pbuh) drew near tohis Lord (and came down) closer,
53|9|(Till he was (distant) two bows length) of the bows used by the Arabs (or even nearer) nearer by half a bowlength,
53|10|(And He revealed unto His slave) Gabriel (that which He revealed) to His slave Muhammad (pbuh); and it issaid this means: and He revealed to His slave Muhammad (pbuh) that which He revealed.
53|11|(The heart) of Muhammad (pbuh) (lied not (in seeing) what it saw) when he saw his Lord with his heart; itis also said that he saw his Lord with his eyes. This is why Allah made His oath.
53|12|When the Prophet (pbuh) informed them of what he saw, they disbelieved him. And so Allah said: (Will yethen dispute with him concerning) will you then disbelieve (what he seeth) what Muhammad (pbuh) saw?
53|13|(And verily he saw him) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) saw Gabriel; and it is said he saw his Lord with his heart;and it is said he saw his Lord with his eyes, (yet another time) other than the time about which he informedyou,

It is also said thatthe verse means: do you deem that your worship of al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat in the life of the world willbenefit you in the Hereafter. No, it will surely not benefit you. As for al-Lat it was an idol which wasworshipped in Thaqif; al-'Uzza was a tree in Batn al-Nakhlah which Ghatafan worshipped; while Manat wasan idol in Mecca which was worshipped beside Allah by Hudhayl and Khuza'ah.

(They follow) they do not worship al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat or that which they call deities(but a guess) except through surmise and have no certainty about their worship (and that which (they)themselves desire) and they also worship them because they follow their own desires.

53|30|(Such is their sum of knowledge) such is the extent at which their knowledge, intellect and opinion end,since they claimed that the angels are Allah's daughters and that there is no Hereafter. (Lo! thy Lord) OMuhammad (is best aware of him who strayeth) from His religion, in reference here to Abu Jahl, (and He isbest aware of him who goeth right) to His religion, in reference here to Abu Bakr.

53|32|Allah then showed their works in the life of the world, saying: (Those who avoid enormities of sin) i.e.idolatry and the major sins (and abominations) adultery and transgressions, (save the unwilled offences)except a furtive look, a taunt, a censure which they then blame themselves for committing and repent ofdoing; it is also said that this means: except marrying ((for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy) towards hewho repents of major and minor sins.

53|35|(Hath he knowledge of the Unseen) the Guarded Tablet (so that he seeth) his doing in it that it is indeed ashe did? This verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan who was of the habit of spending a great deal on,and gives alms to, the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) but then he met 'Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh.The latter said to him: "I see that you spend a great deal on these, and I fear that you may be left withnothing". 'Uthman said to him: "I have faults and sins which I want to expiate and I also want to obtainAllah's good pleasure". 'Abdullah said: "Give me the halter of your camel and I will bear your sins and faultsin this life and in the Hereafter". As a result, he gave him the halter of his camel and confided himself tospending on him. It is because of this that this verse was revealed.

54|2|(And if they behold a portent) like the splitting of the moon (they turn away) they deny the sign (and say:)this sign is nothing but (Prolonged illusion) which will vanish.
54|3|(They denied) the sign and the coming of the Hour (and followed their own lusts) in denying the sign, thecoming of the Hour and worshipping idols. (Yet everything will come to a decision) every word from Allah orHis Messenger regarding promise, threat, tidings of Paradise or hell, mercy or punishment is true, some ofthis will happen in the life of the world, for all to see, and some of it will happen in the Hereafter andeverything there will be manifest.

57|9|(He it is Who sendeth down clear revelations) he sends down Gabriel with clear revelations, expositingcommands and prohibitions, the lawful and unlawful (unto His slave) Muhammad (pbuh) (that He may bringyou forth) through the Qur'an and the call of Muhammad (pbuh) (from darkness unto light) from disbeliefinto faith; and it is also said that this means: He has indeed brought you forth from disbelief into faith; (andlo! for you) O believers, (Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful) for bringing you forth from disbelief into faith.
57|10|(And what aileth you) O believers (that ye spend not in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, (when UntoAllah belongeth the inheritance of the heavens and the earth) the inhabitants of the heavens and the earthwill all perish, and only Him will remain, and the results of all things will go back to Him? (Those) of you, Obelievers (who spent and fought) the enemy along with the Prophet (pbuh) (before the victory) before theconquest of Mecca (are not upon a level (with the rest of you)) are not equal in the sight of Allah in terms ofmerit and obedience. (Such) the people who have this trait (are greater in rank) in merit and standing in thesight of Allah through their obedience and reward-this refers to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq-(than those who spentand fought afterwards) than those who spend after the conquest of Mecca and fight the enemies along withthe Prophet (pbuh) thereafter. (Unto each hath Allah promised good) i.e. the Garden through faith. (AndAllah is Informed of what ye do) of what you spend.
57|11|(Who is he that will lend unto Allah) by giving alms (a goodly loan) sincerely from his heart, intending noone but Allah, (that He may double it for him) that Allah may accept it from Him and increase his rewardfrom seven to 70 up to 700 and one million folds, and up to whatever folds Allah wills, (and his may be arich reward) an abundant reward in the Garden? This verse was revealed about Abu'l-Dahdah.
57|12|(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when thou) O Muhammad (will see the believers) the truebelievers, (men and women, their light shining forth before them and on their right hands) on the Bridgeover hell, the angels will say to them on the Bridge over hell: (Glad news for you this day: Gardens beneathwhich) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (wherein yeare immortal) they will abide in Paradise, never to die or leave. (That is the Supreme Triumph) they earnedParadise and that which is therein and are saved from hell and that which it contains.
57|13|(On the day) i.e. the Day of Judgement (when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say)while on the Bridge over hell (unto those who believe) the true believers: (Look on us) and wait for us, Ogroup of believers, (that we may borrow from your light) that we use your light to see and cross the Bridgeover hell! (it will be said) the believers will say to them; and it is said: the angels will say to them; and it issaid Allah will say to them: (Go back) to the life of the world; and it is said this means: go back to thestopping-place where we were given light (and seek for light!) This is said to the hypocrites out of mockeryby Allah; and it is also said that this is said by the believers; and so the hypocrites will go back seeking light.(Then there will separate them) i.e. the believers and the hypocrites (a wall wherein is a gate, the inner sidewhereof containeth mercy) Paradise, (while the outer side thereof is towards the doom) towards hell.
57|14|(They will cry unto them) behind the gate ((saying): Were we not with you) following your religion, O groupof believers? (They will say: Yea, verily; but ye tempted one another) you ruined yourselves through yoursecret disbelief and hypocrisy, (and hesitated) and you shunned repenting from disbelief and hypocrisy; andit is said that this means: you waited for the death of Muhammad (pbuh) so that you would then reveal yourdisbelief, (and doubted) in Allah, His Scripture and His Messenger, (and vain desires) falsehoods and falsehope (beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass) until the promise of Allah was fulfilled that youdie without repentance from disbelief and hypocrisy; (and the deceiver) i.e. Satan; and it is said that thismeans: the falsehoods of the life of the world (deceived you concerning Allah) concerning the obedience ofAllah;
57|15|(So this day) which is the Day of Judgement (no ransom can be taken from you) O group of hypocrites (norfrom those who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an. (Your home is the Fire) your destinationis the Fire; (that is your patron) it has better right over you, (and a hapless journey's end) they will come to:their companions being the satans, their neighbours the disbelievers, their food the Zaqqum, their drinkboiling water, their clothes pieces of fire and their visitors snakes and scorpions.
57|16|Then Allah mentioned the state of their hearts when they were in the life of the world, saying: (Is not thetime ripe for the hearts of those who believe) outwardly (to submit) to soften, abase itself and be sincere (toAllah's reminder) to Allah's promises and threats; it is also said this means: to Allah's divine Oneness (and tothe Truth which is revealed) to the commands and prohibitions, the lawful and unlawful contained in theQur'an, (that they become not as those who received the Scripture) that they became like those who weregiven the knowledge of the Torah (of old) before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) and so they are the folkof the Torah (but the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened) regarding faith;these are the ones who went against the religion of Moses, (and many of them) of the folk of the Torah (areevil-livers) disbelievers who do not believe in Allah as it is in Allah's foreknowledge.
57|17|(Know that Allah quickeneth the earth) through rain (after its death) after being exposed to dryness anddrought; and similarly Allah will bring the dead back to life through rain.

57|19|(And those who believe in Allah and His messengers) from among all nations, (they are the loyal) in theirfaith; (and the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light) at the Bridge over hell;and it is also said this means that the martyrs mentioned above refer to the witnesses who will testify infavour of the prophets against their respective peoples; and it is said that they refer to those who werekilled while fighting for the sake of Allah: all these have the reward of the prophets in the course ofconveying their message and will also have their light at the Bridge over hell to see their way while crossingit; (while as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations) i.e. the Scripture and Messenger, (they areowners of hellfire) they are the dwellers of the Fire.
57|20|(Know that the life of this world) that which is in the life of this world (is only play) exultation, (and idle talk)falsehood, (and pageantry) an appearance, (and boasting among you) regarding status and lineage, (andrivalry about wealth and children) which will vanish and not last; (as the likeness of vegetation after rain,whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman, but afterward it drieth up and thou seest it turningyellow) after having been green (then it becometh straw) in the same vein, the life of the world will not lastjust as this vegetation did not. (And in the Hereafter there is grievous punishment) for he who abstains fromobeying Allah and withholds the right of Allah, (and (also) forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure) inthe Hereafter, for he who obeys Allah and fulfils Allah's right over his wealth, (whereas the life of the world)i.e. concerning its lastingness and evanescence (is but matter of illusion) like the illusion surrounding theutilities of the house such as plates and bowls.
57|21|Allah then said to all created beings: (Race) in relation to repentance of your sins (one with another forforgiveness from your Lord and a Garden) and for a Garden by means of righteous works (whereof thebreadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth) where they to be joined with each other, (which isin store) which is created and prepared (for those who believe in Allah and His messengers) from among allnations. (Such) forgiveness, Allah's good pleasure and the Garden (is the bounty of Allah) are all bountiesfrom Allah, (which He bestoweth upon whom He will) upon whoever deserves it, (and Allah is of InfiniteBounty) in bestowing Paradise.
57|22|(Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth) such as drought, dryness of land, rise in prices and continuoushunger (or in yourselves) such as sicknesses, pains, misfortunes, the death of one's family members andchildren and loss of wealth (but it is in a Book) He says: all this is decreed upon you and recorded in theGuarded Tablet (before We bring it into being) before they befall the earth or your own selves.

(Allah loveth not all prideful) in their walk (boasters) regarding the bounties of Allah; it is also said thatthis means: Allah loves not all prideful people about their disbelief and boasters about their idolatry; this is inreference to the Jews,
57|24|(Who hoard) who conceal the traits and description of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Torah (and who enjoinupon the people avarice) in the Torah by concealing the traits and description of the Prophet (pbuh).

57|25|(We verily sent Our messengers with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and signs, (and revealedwith them the Scripture) and sent to them Gabriel with the Scripture (and the Balance) expositing there injustice, (that mankind may observe right measure) justice; (and He revealed iron) We created iron, (whereinis mighty power) such that only fire makes it pliable; it is also said that this means: there is in it mightystrength for fighting and war (and (many) uses for mankind) they use it to make things like knives, axes,files and other things, (and that Allah may know) in order that Allah may see (him who helpeth Him and Hismessengers, though unseen) by means of these weapons. (Lo! Allah is Strong) by helping His friends,(Almighty) in retribution against His enemies.
57|26|(And We verily sent Noah) to his folk, 800 years after Adam, and he remained with them for 950 years, butthey refused to believe and Allah destroyed them with the flood (and Abraham) and We have sent Abrahamto his folk, 1240 years after Noah (and placed the prophethood and the Scripture) they had among themprophets and scriptures (among their seed) the seed of Noah and Abraham, (and among them there is hewho goeth right) a believer in the Scripture and Messenger, (but many of them are evil-livers) disbelievers inthe Scripture and Messenger.
57|27|(Then We caused Our messengers) one after the other (to follow in their footsteps) to follow Noah andAbraham from their respective offspring; (and We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow) these Messenger,i.e. messengers other than the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) (and gave him the Gospel, and placedcompassion and mercy) towards each other (in the hearts of those who followed him) i.e. who followed thereligion of Jesus. (But monasticism they invented) they built monasteries and cloisters to escape the seditionof Paul, the Jew. (We ordained it not for them) We did not enjoin monasticism upon them. (Only seekingAllah's pleasure) they did not invent it except to seek Allah's good pleasure, (and) had We enjoined it uponthem (they observed it not with right observance) they would not have given it its right due. (So We givethose of them who believe) among the monks (their reward) double for their faith and worship; these arethe ones who did not contravene against the religion of Jesus. 24 among these were in the Yemen andwhen they heard of the Prophet (pbuh) they believed in him and joined his religion, (but many of them) ofthe monks (are evil-livers) disbelievers, these are the ones who went against the religion of Jesus.
57|28|(O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah) fear Allah (and put faith in His messenger) be firm inyour belief in Allah and His Messenger. (He will give you twofold of His mercy) of His reward andbeneficence (and will appoint for you a light wherein ye shall walk) among people on the Bridge over hell,(and will forgive you) the sins you committed in the pre-Islamic era.

57|29|(That the People of the Scripture) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (may know that they control naughtof the bounty of Allah) of the reward of Allah, (but that the bounty) reward and honour (is in Allah's hand togive to whom He will) whoever deserves it. (And Allah is of Infinite Bounty) in relation to the believers inthat He bestows upon them reward and honours them. The last two verses were revealed about 'AbdullahIbn Salam when he boasted to Ubayy Ibn Ka'b and his friends that they had two rewards while others hadonly one'.
58|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Allah hath heard): '(Allah hath heard) He says: Allah heard before He informed you, O Muhammad,(the saying of her that disputeth) that speaks to and argues (with thee (Muhammad) concerning herhusband, and complaineth unto Allah) and entreats Allah, Exalted is He, to explain her matter. (And Allahheareth your colloquy) and Allah hears your conversation and exchange of words. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) ofyour conversation, (Knower) of her matter. The story is that Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik Ibn al-Dakhshim al-Ansariyyah was married to Aws Ibn al-Samit al-Ansari and the latter, who was touched by thejinn, wanted to have sexual intercourse with her while in her period. When she refused, he became angryand said: "if you leave the house before I have sexual intercourse with you, you are unlawful to me just asmy mother is".
58|2|(Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers)-They are not their mothers) theyare not like their mothers; (none are their mothers) in terms of unmarriageability (except those who gavethem birth) or those whose milk they drank in their infancy (they indeed utter an ill word) when they declaretheir wives unlawful to them, like the unlawfulness of their mothers (and a lie. And lo! Allah is Forgiving)since He did not punish him for declaring unlawful that which Allah made lawful, (Merciful) after he hasrepented and shown remorse.
58|3|Allah explained the expiation for saying to one's wife: "you are unlawful to me just like my mother is"(Zihar), saying: (Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers)) those who makeunlawful for themselves sexual intercourse with their wives (and afterward would go back on that whichthey have said) then go back on making it lawful; ((the penalty) in that case (is) the freeing of a slavebefore they touch one another. Unto this) freeing of a slave (ye are exhorted) as an expiation of the Zihar;(and Allah is informed of what ye do) regarding the Zihar, of expiation and other things.
58|4|(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successivemonths before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for himwho is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones)giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa') of wheat or one measure (sa') of barley or dates. (This)which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and Hismessenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Suchare the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar;(and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to theirhearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malikal-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered byhis wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden onhim. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet(pbuh) told him: "You should free a slave". Aws said: "I have very little money and it costs a great deal tofree a slave". The Prophet (pbuh) said: "Then you should fast two successive months". Aws said: "I cannotdo so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast". The Prophet(pbuh) said: "Then you should feed 60 needy ones". Aws said: "I can not afford it". The Prophet (pbuh)ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: "I do not knowof anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I". The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with thehelp of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wifewhom he had declared unlawful for himself.
58|5|(Those who oppose Allah and His messenger) regarding Religion and show enmity towards him (will beabased) they will be chastised and conquered on the day of the Ditch; they will be killed and defeated; thereference here is to the people of Mecca (even those before them were abased) just as those who hadfought against the prophets before the people of Mecca were chastised and conquered; (and We have sentdown clear tokens) We have sent Gabriel with revelations making clear the commands and prohibitions, thelawful and unlawful, (and for disbelievers) in the revelations of Allah (is a shameful doom) through whichthey will be humiliated; and it is said that a shameful doom means: a severe chastisement.
58|6|(On the day when Allah will raise them all together) will raise the adherents of all religions (and inform themof what they did) in the life of the world. (Allah hath kept account of it) i.e. He has kept account of all theirworks (while they forgot it) while they left the obedience of Allah with which they were commanded. (AndAllah is Witness over all things) over all their works.
58|7|(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that Allah knoweth all thatis in the heavens and all that is in the earth) of creation? (There is no secret conference of three but He istheir fourth) except that Allah knows about them, their works and secret conference, (nor of five but He istheir sixth) He knows them and knows their secret conference, (nor of less than that or more but He is withthem) He knows them and knows their secret conference (wheresoever they may be; and afterward, on theDay of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did) in the life of the world. (Lo! Allah is Knower of allthings) of their works and secret conference. This verse was revealed about Safwan Ibn Umayyah and hisson-in-law; their story is mentioned in the Surah of Prostration.
58|8|(Hast thou not observed) O Muhammad (those who were forbidden conspiracy) other than true believers(and afterward returned to that which they had been forbidden) of conspiracy, leaving aside true believers,(and (now) conspire together) among themselves (for crime) for lies (and wrong-doing) transgression (anddisobedience towards the messenger) by opposing the Messenger after he forbade them from doing so?What happened is that the hypocrites used to hold secret conferences with the Jews regarding the militaryexpeditions of the believers, in order to aggrieve the believers. (And when they) i.e. the Jews (come untothee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not) for they used to say al-sam, i.e.death, be with you [that is instead of saying al-salam, i.e. peace, be with you] and the Prophet (pbuh) usedto answer: "and al-sam be with you", (and say within themselves) to one another: (Why should Allah punishus for what we say) to His Prophet? If he were truly a Prophet, as he claims, his prayer would have beenanswered when he answers: "and al-sam be with you". Allah answered them, saying: (Hell will suffice them)i.e. the Jews as a destination in the Hereafter; (they will feel the heat thereof. A hapless journey's end) ishell wherein they will end!
58|9|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (when ye conspire together) among yourselves,(conspire not together for crime) for lying (and wrong-doing) transgression (and disobedience towards themessenger) by opposing the Messenger like the hypocrites did with the Jews, leaving aside the truebelievers, (but conspire together for righteousness) for performing the obligations of Allah and for beinggood towards one another (and pity) shunning transgressions and boycott, (and keep your duty) fear Allahfor secret conferencing with other than the true believers, (towards Allah, unto whom ye will be gathered) inthe Hereafter.
58|10|(Lo! Conspiracy) of the hypocrites with the Jews while leaving the true believers aside (is only of the devil) isof the obedience of Satan and by his command, (that he may vex those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh)and the Qur'an; (but he can harm them) secret conference of the hypocrites will not harm the believers (notat all unless by Allah's leave) unless it is by Allah's will. (In Allah let believers put their trust) and let themnot put it in other than Him.
58|11|(O ye who believe! When it is said) when the Prophet (pbuh) says: (Make room in assemblies, then makeroom; Allah will make way for you (Hereafter)) in the Hereafter. This was revealed about Thabit Ibn QaysIbn Shammas whose story is mentioned in the Surah of the Private Apartments. It is also said it wasrevealed about a group of people from Badr, among whom were Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas. Thesepeople went to the Prophet (pbuh) on a Friday when he was staying in the apartment of his wife Safiyyah.When they could not find a place where to sit, they stood at the beginning of the assembly. So the Prophet(pbuh) addressed some people who were not among those who participated in the Battle of Badr: so-and-soand so-and-so and so-and-so let those who took part in the Battle of Badr sit in your places. This is becausethe Prophet (pbuh) used to honour all those who fought at the battle of Badr. But when he did that, henoticed that those who were made to give up their seats resented it, and so Allah revealed about them thisverse. (And when it is said, Come up higher!) in prayer, jihad or remembrance (go up higher; Allah will exaltthose who believe) in secret and openly (among you) in ranks, (and those who have knowledge) along withfaith, (to high ranks) merits in Paradise, more than the merits given to those who have faith but have noknowledge. This is because a believer who is knowledgeable is better than a believer who is not. (Allah isinformed of what ye do) of good or evil.
58|12|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (When ye hold conference) when you speak (withthe messenger, offer an alms before your conference). This was revealed about those believers who werewell off and used to speak to the Prophet (pbuh) more than the poor believers, so much so that they vexedboth the Prophet (pbuh) and the poor believers. Allah, therefore, forbade them from doing so andcommanded them to give alms to the poor, one silver coin for each word they would say to him, before theyeven spoke with the Prophet (pbuh). (That) almsgiving (is better) than holding back money (and purer foryou) and purer for your hearts from sins; and it is also said this means: it is purer for the hearts of the poorin that it prevents their hearts from becoming hard. (But if ye cannot find (the wherewithal)) to give alms, Opoor believers, then you can speak with the Prophet (pbuh) as much as you wish without being required togive alms (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives your sins, (Merciful) towards the one among you who diesrepentant.
58|13|When they stopped speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) because of the required almsgiving involved, Allahreproached them for doing so, saying: (Fear ye) are you miserly, O well off people, (to offer alms beforeyour conference) to offer alms to the poor before speaking with the Prophet (pbuh)? (Then, when ye do itnot) when you do not give alms (and Allah hath forgiven you) the question of giving alms, (establishworship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey Allah) in thatwhich He commands you (and His messenger) in that which he commands you. (And Allah is Aware of whatye do) whether it is good or evil. But no one gave alms for speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) except 'Ali IbnAbi Talib who gave to alms a golden piece which he sold for ten silver pieces, and then asked the Prophet(pbuh) a question of ten words.
58|14|Allah then said about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host, because of their alliance with the Jews: (Hast thounot seen) O Muhammad (those who take for friends) for assistance and help (a folk) i.e. the Jews (withwhom Allah is wroth? They) i.e. the hypocrites (are neither of you) in private such that what is due to you isdue to them (nor of them) i.e. the Jews, openly such that whatever is due to the Jews is due to them, (andthey swear a false oath) they falsely swear that they are believers and true in their faith (knowingly) whilethey know they are lying in their oath.
58|15|(Allah hath prepared for them) for the hypocrites: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (a dreadful doom) in thelife of the world and in the Hereafter. (Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do) evil is that which theydo in their state of hypocrisy.
58|16|(They make a shelter of their oaths) they lie in their oath in order not to be killed (and turn (men) from theway of Allah) they secretly turn people away from Allah's religion and obedience; (so theirs will be ashameful doom) with which they will be humiliated in the Hereafter.
58|17|(Their wealth) the abundance of the wealth of the hypocrites and the Jews (and their children) and theabundance of their children (will avail them naught against Allah) against Allah's chastisement. (Such) thehypocrites and the Jews (are rightful owners of the Fire) the inhabitants of the Fire; (they will abide therein)for eternity, neither to die nor leave it.
58|18|(On the day) the Day of Judgement (when Allah will raise them all together) the hypocrites and the Jews,(then will they swear unto Him) we were never hypocrites or disbelievers (as they (now) swear unto you) inthe life of the world, (and they will fancy that they have some standing) with regard to religion. (Lo! is it notthey who are the liars) in their oaths before Allah?
58|19|(The devil hath engrossed them) Satan has conquered them and commanded them to obey him, and theydid, (and so hath caused them to forget remembrance of Allah) until they left obeying Allah in private.(They) i.e. the hypocrites and the Jews (are the devil's party) the army of the devil. (Lo! is it not the devil'sparty) the devil's army (who will be the losers) of the life of the world and the Hereafter?
58|20|(Lo! those who oppose) contravene (Allah and His messenger) in the matter of religion, (they will be amongthe lowest) in the Fire. The reference here is to the Jews and hypocrites.
58|21|(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shallconquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to hisprophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy IbnSalul who said to the true believers: "Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?".
58|22|Allah then revealed about Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah, a man from the Yemen, who wrote a letter to the people ofMecca in which he divulged one of the secrets of the Prophet (pbuh) saying: (Thou wilt not find) OMuhammad (folk) i.e. Hatib (who believe in Allah and the Last Day) resurrection after death (loving thosewho oppose) contravene against (Allah and His messenger) in matters of religion, meaning here the peopleof Mecca: (even though they be their fathers) blood fathers (or, their sons or their brethren or their clan) ortheir own folk or relatives. (As for such) Hatib and his fellow believers, (He hath written faith upon theirhearts) He cast love of faith in their hearts (and hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him) with amercy from Him; and it is said this means: He helped them with a help from Him, (and He will bring theminto Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey andmilk flow, (wherein they will abide) they will dwell in Paradise for eternity, never to die or leave it. (Allah iswell pleased with them) because of their faith, works and repentance, (and they are well pleased with Him)because of the reward and honour they receive from Him. (They are Allah's party) they are Allah's army.(Lo! is it not Allah's party who are the successful?) they are saved from His wrath and chastisement; theseare the ones who found and obtained what they were seeking, and were saved from the evil of that whichthey fled from. Hatib was of those who took part in the Battle of Badr, and his story is found in surah "Shethat is to be examined (al-Mumtahanah)".
59|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying(All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah): '(All that is in the heavens) He says: allthat is in the heavens of creation (and all that is in the earth) of created beings (glorifieth Allah) pray toAllah; and it is also said this means: remember Allah, (and He is the Mighty) in His kingdom and dominion,(the Wise) in His command and decree; He commanded that none should be worshipped except Him.
59|2|(He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved) i.e. Banu'l-Nadir (to go forthfrom their homes) and fortresses (unto the first exile) because they are the first to be gathered and exiledfrom Medina to Historic Syria, and specifically to Jericho and Adhri'at, as a result of breaking their covenantswith the Prophet (pbuh) after the battle of Uhud. (Ye deemed not) you did not have any hope, O group ofbelievers, (that they) i.e. Banu'l-Nadir (would go forth) from Medina to Historic Syria, (while they) theBanu'l-Nadir (deemed that their strongholds) their fortresses (would protect them from Allah) from Allah'schastisement. (But Allah reached them) Allah punished them and humiliated them through the killing of Ka'bIbn al-Ashraf (from a place whereof they reckoned not) they did not think that Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf would bekilled nor did they have any fear regarding this, (and cast terror in their hearts) fear from Muhammad(pbuh) and his Companions, when they did not fear them at all before this (so that they ruined their houses)some of their houses (with their own hands) and throw its stones on the believers (and the hands of thebelievers) and they left some of their homes to the believers who destroyed them and threw their stones atthem. (So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!) learn a lesson, O you who have insight in Religion, fromwhat Allah has done to them concerning their exile.
59|3|(And if Allah had not decreed migration) from Medina to Historic Syria (for them) for the Banu'l-Nadir, (Heverily would have punished them in this world) by exposing them to killing, (and theirs in the Hereafter isthe punishment of the Fire) which is worse than being killed.
59|4|(That) exile and punishment (is because they were opposed to Allah and His messenger) concerningReligion; (and whoso is opposed to Allah) in the matter of religion and shows enmity towards Him, ((forhim) verily Allah is stern in reprisal) in the life of the world as well as in the Hereafter.
59|5|The Prophet (pbuh) then ordered his Companions to cut down their palm-trees except a particular treecalled the 'Ajwah, which he asked them not to cut down. When the Banu'l-Nadir reproached the believers fordoing so, Allah revealed: (Whatsoever palm-trees you cut down) other than the 'Ajwah palm-tree (or leftstanding on their roots) and did not cut down, i.e. the 'Ajwah, (it was by Allah's leave) both commands ofcutting down and not cutting down are from Allah, (in order that He might confound the evil-livers) in orderthat He might humiliate the disbelievers, i.e. the Banu'l-Nadir, through that which you have cut down of theirpalm-trees.
59|6|(And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them) from Banu'l-Nadir, it is solely for theMessenger of Allah (pbuh) and there is nothing in it for you, (ye urged not) you did not use (any horse orriding-camel for the sake thereof) but you walked to it, for it was very close to Medina, (but Allah giveth Hismessenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (lordship over whom He will) the Banu'l-Nadir. (Allah is Able to do all things)in terms of giving help and spoils.
59|7|(That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships) of 'Uraynah,Qurayzah, Banu'l-Nadir, Fadak and Khaybar, (it is for Allah) specifically and there is nothing in it for you (andHis messenger) the command of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) regarding this is permissible, and this is whyhe made the spoils of Fadak and Khaybar an endowment for the needy people; it remained under his controlduring his lifetime, and after his death it came under the control of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, and after him under'Umar, 'Uthman and 'Ali respectively exactly as it was under the control of the Prophet (pbuh) and it remainsso to this day. The Prophet (pbuh) also divided the spoils of Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir on the poorfrom among the Emigrants (al-Muhajirun), he gave them according to their need and the need of theirdependents (and for the near of kin) and he gave some of it to the needy among the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib(and the orphans) and he gave some of it to the orphans, other than the orphans of Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib(and the needy) and gave some of it to the needy, other than the needy of the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib (andthe wayfarer) the guest and the passer-by, (that it become not a commodity) a division (between the richamong you) between the strong among you. (And whatsoever the messenger giveth you) of spoils, (take it)accept it; it is also said that this means: whatever the messenger commands you, act upon it. (Andwhatsoever he forbideth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in that which Hecommanded you. (Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal) when He punishes; this is because they said to the Prophet(pbuh): "Take your share of the spoils and leave us to deal with the rest of it".
59|8|Allah therefore said to them: these spoils-i.e. seven gardens that belonged to the Banu'l-Nadir-(And (it is)for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes) because they were driven out of theirhomes in Mecca (and their belongings) the disbelievers of Mecca expelled them from Mecca, they wereabout one hundred men, (who seek bounty) who seek reward (and pleasure from Allah) and the goodpleasure of Allah by means of jihad (and help Allah and His messenger) through jihad. (They are the loyal)they are the ones who are true in their faith and jihad.
59|9|Then the Prophet (pbuh) to the Helpers (al-Ansar): "These spoils and gardens are solely for the poor amongthe Emigrants. If you wish, I will divide your wealth and properties on the Emigrants and give you a share ofthe spoils, or you keep your wealth and properties and I divide the spoils on the poor among the Emigrants".They said: "O Messenger of Allah, we would like to share our wealth and properties with them and we willalso prefer them over ourselves and let them have the spoils". Allah praised them for this by saying: (Thosewho entered the city) those who made it possible for the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions to live in theabode of migration (and the faith before them) and were believers before the Immigrants came to them(love these who flee unto them for refuge) in Medina from among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh)(and find in their breasts) in their hearts (no need) no resentful envy; and it is said this means: no vexation(for that which hath been given them) of spoils, while they did not get any, (but prefer (the fugitives) abovethemselves) with their wealth and homes (though poverty become their lot. And whoso is saved from hisown avarice) and whoever drives away avarice from his own self (such are they who are successful) suchare they who are saved from Allah's wrath and chastisement.
59|10|(And those who came (into the faith) after them) after the first Emigrants (say: Our Lord Forgive us) oursins (and our brethren who were before us in the faith) and migration, (and place not in our hearts anyrancour) or resentful envy (towards those who believe) among the Emigrants. (Our Lord! Thou art Full ofPity, Merciful) they made these supplications because they were afraid of resentful envy, because theProphet (pbuh) gave the spoils to the first Emigrants and did not give them anything.
59|11|(Hast thou not observed) O Muhammad (those who are hypocrites) those who are double-faced in theirreligion: these were a group of people from the Aws tribe who claimed to be believers in the open but weredisbelievers in private, ((how) they tell) in private (their brethren who disbelieve among the People of theScripture) i.e. Banu Qurayzah; they said to them when they were surrounded by the Prophet (pbuh)"Remain firm in your faith inside your strongholds": (If ye are driven out) from Medina as were driven outthe Banu'l-Nadir, (we surely will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you) and we willnot help anyone in Medina against you, (and if ye are attacked) by the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions(we verily will help you) against them. (And Allah beareth witness) and Allah knows (that they) i.e. thehypocrites (verily are liars) they lie in what they say.
59|12|((For) indeed if they) i.e. the Banu Qurayzah (are driven out) from Medina (they) the hypocrites (go not outwith them, and indeed if they are attacked) by the Prophet (pbuh) (they help not) against Muhammad(pbuh) (and indeed if they had helped them) against Muhammad (pbuh) (they would have turned and fled)in defeat, (and then they would not have been victorious) they will not escape what will befall them.
59|13|Allah then said to the believers: (Ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah) He says: the fearof the Jews and hypocrites of the swords of Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions is greater than theirfear of Allah. (That) fear (is because they are a folk who understand not) the command of Allah or Allah'sdivine Oneness.
59|14|(They) i.e. Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir (will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages orfrom behind walls) or if there is between you and them walls. (Their adversity among themselves is verygreat) He says: their fighting against each other is great, for they fought against their own folk and notagainst the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions. (Ye think of them as a whole) united (whereas their heartsare diverse) whereas they differ a great deal. (That) differing and betrayal (is because they are a folk whohave no sense) is because they do not understand Allah's command and divine Oneness.
59|15|(On the likeness of those (who suffered) a short time before them) He says: the similitude of Banu Qurayzahwith regard to breaking covenants and the punishment inflicted upon them as a result is like that of theBanu'l-Nadir two years before them, (they taste the ill-effects of their conduct) they, i.e. Banu'l-Nadir, tastethe punishment of breaking their covenant, (and theirs is painful punishment) in the Hereafter.
59|16|((And the hypocrites) with the Banu Qurayzah upon failing them ((are) on the likeness of the devil) with themonk (when he telleth man) the monk Barsisa (to disbelieve) in Allah, (then, when he disbelieveth) he letshim down and (says: Lo! I am quit of thee) and of your religion. (Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
59|17|And the consequence for both) the devil and the monk (will be that they are in the Fire, therein abiding.Such) eternity in hell (is the reward of evil-doers) is the punishment of the disbelievers.
59|18|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad, Allah bless him and the Qur'an! (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah.(And let every soul) whether it is righteous or sinful (look to that which it sendeth on before for the morrow)to what it achieved for the Day of Judgement, for it will only find on the Day of Judgement that which it hasperformed in the life of the world; if it is good, it is good, and if it is evil, it is evil. (And observe your duty toAllah) and fear Allah! (Lo! Allah is informed of what ye do) of good and evil.
59|19|(And be not ye) O believers, with regard to sinning, (as those who forgot Allah) as those who shunned theobedience of Allah openly and in private, i.e. the Jews, (therefore He caused them to forget their souls)therefore Allah forsook them such that they left His obedience altogether. (Such are the evil-doers) such arethe disbelievers in Allah in private, i.e. the hypocrites; and if it is taken to mean the Jews, this means: suchare the disbelievers in Allah openly and in private.
59|20|(Not equal) in acts of obedience and reward (are the owners of the Fire) the dwellers of the Fire (and theowners of the Garden) and the dwellers of the Garden. (The owners of the Garden, they are the victorious)they gained the Garden and were saved from the Fire.
59|21|(If We had caused this Qur'an) which is recited unto you by Muhammad (pbuh) (to descend upon amountain) a tremendous mountain whose summit is high in the sky and whose base is deep in the seventhearth, (thou (O Muhammad) verily hadst seen it) i.e. the mountain with all its might (humbled) surrenderedbecause of the promises and threats contained in the Qur'an, (rent asunder) cracked and crumbled (by thefear of Allah) from the fear of Allah. (Such similitudes coin We for mankind) in the Qur'an (that haply theymay reflect) upon the similitudes of the Qur'an.

(Glorified be Allah) Allah exonerates Himself (from all that they ascribe as partner(unto Him)) of idols.
59|24|(He is Allah, the Creator) of sperms in the loins of fathers, (the Shaper out of naught) Who transforms themfrom one state to another, (the Fashioner) of what is in the wombs: i.e. whether it is a male or female,felicitous or damned; it is also said that this means: He Who places the spirit in the living being.

(All that is in the heavens) of creation (and the earth) all that is possessed of life(glorifieth Him) prays to Him; and it is also said this means: remembers Him, (and He is the Mighty) inretribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Wise) in His command and decree; He commanded thatnone should be worshipped except Him'.
60|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (O ye who believe!): (O ye who believe!) referring to Hatib, (Choose not My enemy) in religion (andyour enemy) who fight you, i.e. the people of Mecca (for friends) seeking their assistance and help. (Do yegive them friendship) you send them a letter to assist and help them (when they disbelieve in that truthwhich hath come unto you) i.e. to Hatib, (driving out the messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) from Mecca (andyou) i.e. Hatib (because ye believe) because of your faith (in Allah, your Lord? If ye have come forth) if youhave, O Hatib, come forth from Mecca to Medina (to strive in My way) for the sake of My obedience (andseeking My good pleasure, (show them not friendship). Do ye show friendship unto them in secret) do notsend letters to them in secret to assist and help them, (when I am best Aware of what ye hide) i.e. of whatyou hide, O Hatib, regarding the letter; and it is also said that this means: regarding your faith (and what yeproclaim) O Hatib, of excuse; and it is also said: of profession of Allah's divine Oneness? (And whosoeverdoeth it among you) whoever of you, O believers, does as Hatib did, (he verily hath strayed from the rightway) he has indeed strayed from the path of guidance.
60|2|(If they have the upper hand of you) if the people of Mecca defeat you, (they will be your foes) by killingyou, it will be evident for you that they are your enemies, (and will stretch out their hands) to beat you (andtheir tongues towards you with evil (intent)) with abuse and slander, (and they) the disbelievers of Mecca(long for you to disbelieve) in Allah after you have accepted faith in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'anand migrated to Allah's Messenger (pbuh).
60|3|(Your ties of kindred) in Mecca, if you were to disbelieve, (and your children will avail you naught upon theDay of Resurrection) against Allah's chastisement. (He will part you) He will separate you from the believerson the Day of Judgement; and it is also said this means: He will judge between you on this. (Allah is Seer ofwhat ye do) of good and evil.
60|4|(There is a goodly pattern) a good example (for you) O Hatib (Abraham) in Abraham's words (and thosewith him) and also in the words of the believers who were with him, (when they told their folk) when theytold their disbelieving kinsfolk; (Lo! we are guiltless of you) of your kinship and religion (and all that yeworship beside Allah) of idols. (We have done with you) we absolve ourselves from you and from yourreligion. (And there hath arisen between us and you hostility) through killing and beating (and hate) in thehearts (for ever until ye believe in Allah only) until you declare Allah's divine Oneness (save that whichAbraham promised) save the words of Abraham to (his father (when he said): I will ask forgiveness for thee)because he promised him to do so, but when his father died in a state of disbelief, Abraham disavowed him,saying: (though I own nothing for thee from Allah) from Allah's chastisement. Allah then taught them whatto say: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (In Thee we put our trust) we rely on you, (and unto Thee we turnrepentant) we turn to your obedience, (and unto Thee is the journeying) and unto You is the return in theHereafter.
60|5|(Our Lord!) Say: O our Lord! (Make us not a prey for those who disbelieve) for the disbelievers of Mecca;they said: do not set them on us, lest they think they are following the Truth while we are followingfalsehood, which will only embolden them against us, (and forgive us) our sins, (our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lo!Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty) in retribution against whoever does not believe in You, (the Wise) inhelping those who believe in You.
60|6|(Verily ye have in them) you have, O Hatib, in the words of Abraham and the believers with him (a goodlypattern) a good example to emulate (for everyone who looketh to Allah) for everyone who fears Allah (andthe Last Day) and resurrection after death. Would it not be better for you, O Hatib, to say as Abraham andthe believers with him said. (And whosoever may turn away) from what he was commanded by Allah, (lo!still Allah, He is the Absolute) Allah is free of need for him as He is free of need for His creation, (the Ownerof Praise) Who is praiseworthy in His acts; and it is said this means: the Owner of Praise regarding the onewho professes His divine Oneness; and it is also said that the Owner of Praise means: He is thankful for littlebut He rewards for it abundantly.
60|7|(It may be) "may be" when used in connection with Allah denotes a requisite (that Allah will ordain love) abond and marriage relationships; and it so happened that the Prophet (pbuh) married, upon the conquest ofMecca, Umm Habibah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan, and this became a bond between them and the Prophet(pbuh) (between you and those of them with whom ye are at enmity) those of the people of Mecca whomyou oppose with regard to religion. (Allah is Mighty) He is able to give His Prophet the upper hand over thedisbelievers of Quraysh, (and Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever amongt them repents of disbelief andaccepts faith in Allah, (Merciful) towards whoever amongst them dies in a state of faith and repentance.
60|8|(Allah forbideth you not) to help and have relations with (those who warred not against you on account ofreligion and drove you not out from your homes) i.e. from Mecca, nor helpe those who drove you out of it,(that ye should show them kindness) that you should have relations with them and help them (and dealjustly with them) by honouring your pledges to them. (Lo! Allah loveth the just dealers) the just ones whohonour their pledges. The latter are Khuza'ah, the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir, and Khuzaymah and theBanu Mudlij who signed a treaty with the Prophet (pbuh) before the year of the al-Hudaybiyyah and whichstipulated that they will not fight against him, drive him out of Mecca or help anyone to drive him out ofMecca. It is for this reason that Allah did not forbid him from having relations with them.
60|9|(Allah forbideth you only those) He forbids you from having relations with those (who warred against you onaccount of religion) the people of Mecca (and have driven you out from your homes) Mecca (and helped todrive you out) from Mecca, (that you make friends of them) seeking their assistance and help. (Whosoevermaketh friends of them) seeking their help and assistance ((All) such are wrong-doers) who harmthemselves.
60|10|(O ye who believe! When believing women) who truly believe in Allah (come unto you as fugitives) fromMecca to Medina or al-Hudaybiyyah, (examine them) ask them and let them swear as to their intentionsfrom their coming. (Allah is best aware of their faith) Allah is best aware of their hearts' firmness in faith.(Then, if ye know them for true believers) through examination, (send them not back unto the disbelievers)do not send them back to their disbelieving husbands. (They are not) i.e. the believing women, (lawful forthe disbelievers) for their disbelieving husbands, (nor are the disbelievers lawful for them) for the believingwomen. Allah says: a believing woman is not lawful for a disbelieving man nor is a disbelieving womanlawful for a believing man. (And give the disbelievers that which they have spent (upon them)) give theirhusbands that which they have spent on them as dower. This was revealed about Subay'ah Bint al-Harth al-Aslamiyyah who came to the Prophet (pbuh) in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, to declare her Islam but herhusband Musafir came after her to take her back. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give peace, gave himback the dowry which her husband had given her. In that particular year, and before the revelation of thisverse, the people of Mecca had signed a treaty with the Prophet (pbuh) which stipulated that whoever fromthe people of Mecca embraces Islam can join the Muslims, and whoever of the Muslims embraces thereligion of the Meccan pagans is returned to the Muslims; and any woman from the people of Mecca whoembraces Islam, the Muslims should pay back the dowry given to her to her husband, and any Muslimwoman who joins the religion of the Meccan pagans, the people of Mecca should pay back her dowry to herhusband. This is why the Prophet (pbuh) paid back to Musafir the dowry which he had given to Subay'ah.(And it is no sin for you) O believers (to marry such women) those who were disbelievers and thenembraced Islam (when ye have given them their dues) when you have given them their dowry. Allah sayshere: any woman who embraces Islam while her husband remains a disbeliever, the sacred bond that tiesher to her husband becomes broken and, therefore, she does not have to observe a waiting period and canmarry after making sure she is not pregnant. (And hold not to the ties of disbelieving women) He says: anywoman who disbelieves in Allah has broken the sacred bond that ties her to her husband; and therefore heshould not consider her his wife; (and ask for (the return of) that which ye have spent) He says: ask thepeople of Mecca to give back what you have spent on them, if your wives join their religion; (and let thedisbelievers ask for that which they have spent) on their wives when the latter embrace Islam. And thisexactly what they had agreed with the Prophet (pbuh). (That is the judgement of Allah) that is the obligationof Allah. (He judgeth between you) and the people of Mecca. (Allah is Knower) of what is best for you,(Wise) in that which He judged between you. This verse is abrogated by unanimous consensus of Muslims.
60|11|(And if any of your wives have gone from you unto the disbelievers) with whom you do not have any treatyor pledge (and afterward ye have your turn (of triumph)) and afterward you obtain booty from the enemy,(then give unto those whose wives have gone) to the disbelievers (the like of that which they have spent) ofdowry on their wives; this should be given before the fifth of the booty is taken out from it, (and keep yourduty to Allah) fear Allah regarding that which He commands you (in whom ye are believers) true believers.There were just six women who left Islam and joined the disbelievers of Mecca, two of them were wives of'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, Umm Salamah and Umm Kulthum Bint Jarul, and also Umm al-Hakam the daughter ofAbu Sufyan who was the wife of 'Abbad Ibn Shaddad al-Fihri, and Fatimah Bint Abi Umayyah Ibn al-Mughirah and Buru' Bint 'Uqbah who was the wife of Shammas Ibn 'Uthman from the Banu Makhzum, and'Abdah Bint 'Abd al-'Uzza Ibn Nadlah whose husband was 'Amr Ibn Wudd, and Hind Bint Abu Jahl IbnHisham whose husband was Hashim Ibn al-'Ass Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi. The Prophet (pbuh) gave back to thehusbands of these women the dowry they had spend on them.
60|12|(O Prophet!) Meaning Muhammad (If believing women) the woman of the people of Mecca (come untothee) after the conquest of Mecca, (taking oath of allegiance unto thee that they will ascribe nothing aspartner unto Allah) among idols nor deem this to be lawful, (and will neither steal) or deem stealingpermitted (nor commit adultery) or deem it lawful (nor kill their children) nor bury their daughters alive ordeem this to be lawful, (nor produce any lie) nor bring any child conceived from fornication (that they havedevised between their hands and feet) and then tell their husbands it is theirs, (nor disobey you in what isright) nor disobey you in all that which you command and forbid them such as shunning wailing, pulling outtheir hair, tearing apart their clothes, scratching their faces, rending their outer garments, shaving theirheads, being alone with strangers or travelling alone a journey of three days or less without the company ofan unmarriageable person, (then accept their allegiance) on this (and ask Allah to forgive them) that whichthey committed in the pre-Islamic era.

61|2|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (why say ye that which ye do not?) why do youspeak about that which you do not act upon? This is because they said: "O Messenger of Allah! If we knewthe most beloved deed to Allah, we would certainly do it". But when he informed them about the workswhich are dear to Him in His saying (O ye who believe! Shall I show you a commerce that will save you froma painful doom?) whose pain extends to the hearts, they waited for as long as Allah willed, but Allah did notexplain further. They then said: "if only we knew what it is so that we give for it our wealth, persons andfamilies". Allah answered by saying (Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for thecause of Allah with your wealth and your lives...), and so Allah explained to them what to do, saying: youshould be firm in your belief in Allah and His Messenger and you should also strive to obey Allah using yourwealth and own persons. But when they were tried in the Battle of Uhud and ran away from the battlefield,leaving the Prophet (pbuh) behind, Allah reproached them saying: why do you promise that which youcannot fulfil and why talk about that which you cannot perform?
61|3|(It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not) that you promise that which youcannot fulfil or speak of doing that which you cannot do.

So when they went astray) when they deviated from theTruth and guidance (Allah sent their hearts astray) from the Truth and guidance; it is also said that thismeans: when they lied about Moses, Allah turned away their hearts from the declaration of Allah's divineOneness; and it is also said that this means: when they deviated from the Truth and guidance, Allahincreased the deviance of their hearts.

The reference here is to the Jews whom the Prophet (pbuh) invited to embracethe profession of Allah's divine Oneness. (And Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk) He guides not to Hisreligion those Jews whom He knew in His preeternal knowledge that they will die as Jews.
61|8|(Fain would they) i.e. the Jews and Christians (put out the light of Allah) to abort the religion of Allah; and itis said this means: to abort the Book of Allah: the Qur'an, (with their mouths) with their tongues and lies,(but Allah will perfect His light) but Allah will manifest His religion and Book (however much the disbelieversare averse) even though the Jews, Christians and pagan Arabs dislike its happening.
61|9|(He it is Who hath sent His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (with the guidance) with the message of Allah'sdivine Oneness; and it is also said this means: with the Qur'an (and the religion of truth) the testificationthat there is no deity except Allah, (that He may make it conqueror of all religion) such that the Hour will notcome except that people are either among the Muslims or among those who pay the capitation tax to theMuslims (however much idolaters may be averse) even though the Jews, Christians and Pagan Arabs dislikeits happening.
61|10|(O ye who believe!) And He explained who they are at the beginning of the surah (Shall I show you acommerce that will save you from a painful doom) in the Hereafter?
61|11|(Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger) you should be true in your faith in Allah and His Messenger,if this is understood to be a call to be the opposite of the hypocrites, (and should strive for the cause ofAllah) in obedience of Allah (with your wealth and your lives) by spending your wealth and sacrificing yourown persons. (That) striving (is better for you) wealth, (if ye did but know) if you believe in the reward ofAllah.
61|12|(He will forgive you your sins) through striving and spending in the way of Allah (and bring you into Gardensunderneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk, (andpleasant dwellings) all lawful for you; and it is also said this means: pure dwellings; and it is also said thismeans: beautiful and seemly dwellings; and it is also said this means: pleasant dwellings which Allah hasperfumed with Musk and sweet basil (in Gardens of Eden) in the abode of the Beneficent. (That) which Ihave mentioned (is the Supreme Triumph) the tremendous triumph: they have gained the Garden and weresaved from the Fire.
61|13|(And (He will give you) another blessing which you love) which you long for and desire to have: (help fromAllah) through Muhammad (pbuh) against the disbelievers of Mecca (and present victory) and the conquestof Mecca soon. (Give good tidings (O Muhammad) to believers) to the true believers that they will enter theGarden.
61|14|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Be Allah's helpers) be helpers to Muhammad(pbuh) against his enemies; it is also said this means: be Allah's helpers against His enemies, (even as Jesusson of Mary said unto the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah) who are my helpers, along with Allah,against His enemies? (They said) his disciples said: (We are Allah's helpers) we are your helpers, along withAllah, against His enemies. They were 12 male disciples, the first to believe in him and help him against hisenemies. All of these men were believers. (And a party of the Children of Israel believed) in Jesus the son ofMary, (while a party disbelieved) in Jesus son of Mary. This is the party that was led astray by Paul and didnot believe in him. (Then We strengthened) We helped and fortified (those who believed) in Jesus the sonof Mary and did not oppose his religion (against their foe) those who opposed the religion of Jesus, (andthey became the uppermost) in argument against their foes because of their prayer to Allah, and it is alsosaid because they were among those who glorified Allah'.
62|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying(All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah): '(All that is in the heavens) of createdbeings (and all that is in the earth) of creatures and living beings (glorifies Allah) prays to Allah; and it isalso said this means: remembers Allah, (the Sovereign Lord) the Eternal whose sovereignty does not perish,(the Holy One) the Pure who has no son or partner, (the Mighty) the All-Conquering in His sovereignty andin His retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Wise) in His command and decree, and He hasdecreed that none should be worshipped but Him.
62|2|(He it is Who hath sent among the unlettered ones) the Arabs (a messenger of their own) of their ownlineage, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (to recite unto them His revelations) the Qur'an which exposits commandsand prohibitions (and to make them grow) and to cleanse them from idolatry by means of belief in Allah'sdivine Oneness; and it is also said this means: He cleanse them by means of them giving the poor-due fromtheir wealth, and also by them repenting; in other words: He invites them to do so, (and to teach them theScripture) i.e. the Qur'an (and Wisdom) the lawful and the unlawful; it is also said this means: knowledgeand the admonitions of the Qur'an, (though heretofore) before the Prophet (pbuh) brought them the Qur'an(they) i.e. the Arabs (were indeed in error manifest) in manifest disbelief,
62|3|(Along with others of them) of the Arabs; and it is also said: of the clients (who have not yet joined them)who have not joined the first Arabs. He says: they have not joined yet but they will join later. He says: Allahsent Muhammad (pbuh) as a Messenger to the Arabs as well as to the clients. (He is the Mighty) inretribution against those who disbelieve in Him, in His Scripture and in His Messenger Muhammad (pbuh)(the Wise) in His command and decree and He has decreed that none should be worshipped except Him.
62|4|(That) which I have mentioned regarding prophethood, Scriptures and the confession of Allah's divineOneness (is the bounty of Allah) is a bounty from Allah; (which He giveth unto) and honour with (whom hewill) whoever deserves it. (Allah is of Infinite Bounty) by bestowing Islam and prophethood uponMuhammad (pbuh); and it is also said this means: by bestowing Islam upon the believers; and it is also saidthis means: by sending the Messenger and Scripture to His created beings.
62|5|(The likeness) the description (of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses) of those who werecommanded to apply that which is in the Torah; i.e. they were commanded to reveal the traits anddescription of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Torah, (yet apply it not) yet act not upon what they werecommanded, i.e. they did not reveal the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Torah, (is as thelikeness of the ass carrying books) the ass does not benefit from the books it carries and, similarly, the Jewswill not benefit from the Torah. (Wretched is the likeness of folk who deny the revelations of Allah)Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an. This refers to the Jews. (And Allah guideth not) to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the Jews; those who are to die following Judaism, as it is in Allah's pre-eternal knowledge.
62|6|(Say) O Muhammad: (O ye who are Jews!) O you who have deviated from Islam and became Jews. Theseare the sons of Judah (If ye claim that you are favoured of Allah) if you claim you are the beloved of Allah(apart from (all) mankind) apart from Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions, (then long for death) thenask for death (if ye are truthful) that you are favoured by Allah apart from Muhammad (pbuh) and hisCompanions. That is to say, say: O Allah! Make us die! For by Allah, there is not a single one of them whosays this except that he will die.
62|7|However, they did not want to say it and ask for death. Upon which Allah said: (But they will never long forit) but the Jews will never ask for death (because of all that their own hands have sent before) because ofthat which they committed in their adherence to Judaism, (and Allah is Aware of evil-doers) He is aware thatthe Jews will not ask for death.
62|8|(Say) unto them, O Muhammad: (Lo! the death from which ye shrink) the death which you dislike (willsurely meet you) will inevitably befall you, (and afterward ye will be returned) in the Hereafter (unto theKnower of the invisible) i.e. that which is hidden from the slaves and will happen in the future (and thevisible) that which the people know and has already happened, (and He will tell you what ye used to do) andsay whether it is good or evil.
62|9|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (When the call is heard for the prayer) when thecall to prayer calls you for the prayer (of the day of congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah) hasteto the sermon of the Imam and to praying with him (and leave your trading) and leave trading after the callto prayer. (That) listening to the sermon of the Imam and prayer (is better for you) than earning money andtrading (if ye did but know) if you believe in the reward of Allah.
62|10|Allah then gave them a dispensation, after imposing a prohibition upon them, in His saying (and leave yourtrading) and said: (And when the prayer is ended) when the Imam finishes the Friday prayer, (then dispersein the land) then leave the mosque if you wish (and seek of Allah's bounty) and seek Allah's provision if youwish, and this is the dispensation which came after prohibition. There is also another way of understandingthis: when the Imam finishes the Friday prayer, disperse in the mosque and seek that which is better foryou, i.e. the hidden knowledge, Oneness, non-attachment and reliance on Allah, (and remember Allah) withyour tongues and hearts (much) in all circumstances, (that ye may be successful) that you may escapeAllah's chastisement and wrath.
62|11|(But when they) this refers to Dihyah Ibn Khalifah al-Kalbi (spy) hear the sound of the drum or (somemerchandise or pastime they break away to it) they disperse and leave the mosque (and leave you standing)only eight men remained in the mosque; and it is also said: only 12 men and two women remained in themosque. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (That which Allah hath) of reward (is better) for you (than pastime)the sound of the drum (and than merchandise) of Dihyah al-Kalbi; He says: if you had stayed with yourProphet and prayed behind him and then made supplications before leaving the mosque, that would havebeen better for you in terms of reward and bestowal of honour from Allah, and much better than leaving themosque without doing this, (and Allah is the Best of providers) Allah is the best of those who give; i.e. saythis when the hypocrites come to you'.
63|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (When the hypocrites come unto thee): '(When the hypocrites come unto thee (O Muhammad)) whenthe hypocrites of Medina, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and Jadd Ibn Qays-who were cousins-come to you, (they say: We bear witness) we swear by Allah (that thou art) O Muhammad (indeed Allah'smessenger) we know this and are conscious of it. (And Allah knoweth) and Allah bears witness (that thouart) O Muhammad (indeed His messenger) without the need for the testimony of the hypocrites, (and Allahbeareth witness) and Allah knows (that the Hypocrites are speaking falsely) that the hypocrites lie in theiroath, because they do not know it nor are their hearts conscious of it.
63|2|(They make their faith) they make their oath by Allah (a pretext) to escape being killed (that they may turn(men) from the way of Allah) and bar people from Allah's religion and obedience in secret. (Verily evil is thatwhich they are wont to do) evil is that which they do in their state of disbelief and hypocrisy, of plotting,treachery and turning people away,
63|3|(That) which I have mentioned regarding the hypocrites (is because they believed) outwardly, (thendisbelieved) and became firm in their disbelief inwardly, (therefore their hearts are sealed) as a punishmentfor their disbelief and hypocrisy (so that they understand not) the Truth or guidance.
63|4|(And when thou) O Muhammad (seest them) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his two friends (their figuresplease thee) their bodies and appearance please you; (and if they speak) saying: we know you are Allah'sMessenger (thou givest ear unto their speech) you believe what they say and think they are truthful whilethey are not. ((They are)) i.e. their bodies are (as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks)aligned against the wall; He says: there is no goodness or light in their hearts just as dry wood has no life ormoistness in it. (They deem every shout) every noise in Medina (to be against them) because of theircowardice. (They are the enemy, so beware of them) and never feel safe from them. (Allah confound them)Allah cursed them! (How they are perverted!) How they lie; it is also said this means: how they turn peopleaway through lies!
63|5|(And when it is said unto them) when their clans said to them after their exposure: (Come) to Allah'sMessenger and repent of disbelief and hypocrisy! (The Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you! theyavert their faces) and cover their heads (and thou seest them) O Muhammad (turning away) from askingforgiveness, repenting and coming to you, (disdainful) too proud to repent and to ask for forgiveness.
63|6|(Whether thou ask forgiveness for them) i.e. for the hypocrites, (or ask not forgiveness for them, Allah willnot forgive them) as long as they persist on that. (Lo! Allah guideth not) forgives not (the evil-living folk) thehypocrites, i.e. those people whom Allah knew in His pre-eternal knowledge that they will die as hypocrites.
63|7|(They it is who say) the one who said this is 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, especially to his host at the Battle ofTabuk: (Spend not on behalf of those (who dwell) with Allah's messenger) who are poor and needy (thatthey may disperse (and go away from you)) to join their clans; (when Allah's are the treasures of theheavens and the earth) when Allah has the keys to the stores of the heavens through providing rain andvegetation; (but the hypocrites) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (comprehend not) that Allah provides forthem.
63|8|(They say) the one who said this is 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, especially to his host at the Battle of Tabuk:(Surely, if we return to Medina) from this battle (the mightier) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (will soon drive out)of Medina (the weaker) the weak and humble, meaning by this Muhammad (pbuh); (when might belongethto Allah and to His messenger and the believers) to conquer the hypocrites, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and hishost; (but the hypocrites know not) this nor believe in it.
63|9|Here the story of Zayd Ibn Arqam is also mentioned (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and theQur'an! (Let not your wealth) in Mecca (nor your children) also in Mecca (distract you from remembrance ofAllah) from migration and jihad. (Those who do so) whoever is distracted by his wealth and children frommigrating and striving, (they are the losers) who will face punishment.
63|10|(And spend) give alms for the sake of Allah (of that wherewith We have provided you) of wealth; and it isalso said this means: pay the poor-due from your wealth (before death) the seizure of death (cometh untoone of you and he saith: My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve me for a little while) as long as I lived in thelife of the world, (then I would give alms) from my wealth and also give the poor-due (and be among therighteous) and use that wealth to go to pilgrimage.
63|11|(But Allah reprieveth no soul when its term comes, and Allah is Aware of what ye do) whether it is good orevil. From His saying (O ye who believe) up to here was revealed about the hypocrites; as for Allah's saying(then I would give alms and be among the righteous) if it is taken to mean the hypocrites, then it wouldmean: I will do with my wealth as the believers do and be among those who are true in their faith'.
64|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah): '(All that is in the heavens) ofcreatures (and all that is in the earth) of creatures and living things (glorifieth Allah) pray to Allah; and it isalso said this means: remember Allah; (unto Him belongeth sovereignty) perpetual sovereignty which nevervanishes (and unto Him belongeth praise) thanks and gratitude are due to Him from the dwellers of theheavens and the earth; and it is also said this means: thanks and gratitude are due to Him from the peopleof the life of the world as well as from the people of the Hereafter, (and He is Able to do all things) relatingto the matters of the life of the world and the matters of the Hereafter, and to the adornment of thedwellers of the heavens and the dwellers of the earth.
64|2|(He it is Who created you) from Adam and Adam is from dust, (but one of you is a disbeliever) openly (andone of you is a believer) openly; it is also said that this means: one of you is a disbeliever who becomes abeliever-this is said as an encouragement to accept faith-and one of you is a believer who becomes adisbeliever-this is a warning against disbelief-; it is also said that this means: one of you is a disbeliever bothinwardly and outwardly-this is the real disbeliever-and one of you is a believer inwardly and outwardly andthis is the real believer, and one of you is a disbeliever inwardly and a believer outwardly, and this is thehypocrite, (and Allah is Seer of what ye do) of good and evil.
64|3|(He created the heavens and the earth with truth) in order to explain the Truth and falsehood; and it is alsosaid this means: He created the heavens and the earth and they are both destined to vanish and beannihilated, (and He shaped you) in the wombs (and made good your shapes) better than the shapes ofbeasts; and it is also said this means: He made your shapes seemly by giving you two hands, two feet, twoeyes, two ears and all the other members, (and unto Him is the journeying) and unto Him is the return afterdeath.
64|4|(He knoweth all that is in the heavens) of creation (and all that is in the earth) of created beings, (and Heknoweth what ye conceal) of deeds (and what ye publish) of works (and Allah is Aware of what is in thebreasts (of men)) He is Aware of what is in the hearts of good and evil.
64|5|(Hath not the story) the event (reached you) O people of Mecca (of those who disbelieved of old) of thenations who were before, how We dealt with them (and so did taste the ill effects of their conduct) and sodid taste the punishment they deserved in the life of the world by being chastised and destroyed, (and theirswill be a painful doom) in the Hereafter.
64|6|(That) torment (was because their messengers (from Allah) kept coming unto them with clear proofs (ofAllah's Sovereignty)) detailing commands, prohibitions and signs, (but they said: Shall mere mortals) humanbeings like us (guide us) call us to believe in Allah's divine Oneness? (So they disbelieved) in the Scriptures,messengers and signs (and turned away) from accepting faith in the Scriptures, messengers and signs, (andAllah was independent (of them)) of their faith. (Allah is Absolute) Allah is free of need for their faith,(Owner of Praise) He is praiseworthy in His acts; it is also said that this means: He is the Owner of Praise asfar as those who believe in His divine Oneness are concerned.
64|7|(Those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (assert that they will not be raised again) after they die.(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Yea, verily, by my Lord! ye will be raised again) after you die (and then yewill be informed of what ye did) in the life of the world of good and evil; (and that) resurrection after death(is easy for Allah.
64|8|So believe) O people of Mecca (in Allah and His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) and in resurrection afterdeath (and the light) the Scripture (which We have revealed) with which We sent Gabriel to Muhammad(pbuh). (And Allah is Aware of what ye do) of good and evil.
64|9|(The day) which is the day of Judgement (when He shall gather you unto the Day of Assembling) when theearlier and later generations will be assembled, (that will be a day of mutual disillusion) the disbeliever willbe duped regarding his own person, family, servants and properties in Paradise and the believer will inherithim; it is also said that this means: the believer will dupe the disbeliever regarding his family and properties,and the disbeliever will be duped about his own person in the Garden and the believer will inherit him, andthe wronged will dupe the one who wronged him by taking his good deeds and giving him his own evildeeds. (And whoso believeth in Allah) and in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and does right) sincerelybetween himself and his Lord, (He will remit from him his evil deeds) He will forgive his sins because of hisbelief in Allah's divine Oneness (and will bring him into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees andhabitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (therein to abide for ever) dwelling inParadise never to die or leave it. (That is the Supreme Triumph) that is the supreme gain: they gained theGarden and are saved from the Fire.
64|10|(But those who disbelieve) in Allah: the disbelievers of Mecca (and deny Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh)and the Qur'an, (such are owners of the Fire) they are inhabitants of the Fire; (they will abide therein) theywill abide in the Fire, never to die or leave it (a hapless journey's end) in the Hereafter in which they haveended up!
64|11|(No calamity befalleth) you in your bodies, families or wealth (save by Allah's leave) and decree. (Andwhosoever believeth in Allah) seeing that the calamity is from Allah, (He guideth his heart) to havecontentment and patience; it is also said: when Allah gives him, he is thankful and when Allah tries him, heis patient and when he wrongs someone, he asks for forgiveness, and when a calamity befalls him, he says:"verily we are unto Allah, and unto Him we shall return". (And Allah is Knower of all things) that befall you,whether it is a calamity or something else.
64|12|(Obey Allah) with regard to His obligations (and obey His messenger) with regard to his practices; it is alsosaid this means: obey Allah regarding Allah's divine Oneness and obey His Messenger by accepting hismessage; (but if ye turn away) from their obedience, (then the duty of Our messenger) Muhammad (pbuh)(is only to convey (the message)) on behalf of Allah (plainly) i.e. in a language that you understand.
64|13|(Allah! There is no God save Him) He has no son or partner. (In Allah, therefore, let believers put their trust)the believers should rely on Allah and not on anyone else.
64|14|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Lo! Among your wives and your children) whoare in Mecca (there are enemies for you) in that they barred you from migration and jihad, (thereforebeware of them) lest you fail to migrate or engage in jihad. (And if ye efface) if you pardon them for barringyou (and overlook) and turn away from them, and not punish them (and forgive) their sins after they havemigrated from Mecca to Medina, (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives he who repents, (Merciful) towardshe who die repentant.
64|15|(Your wealth and your children) who are in Mecca (are only a temptation) they are a calamity for you if theyprevent you from migrating and taking part in jihad, (whereas Allah! with Him is an immense reward) for hewho migrates and takes part in jihad in the way of Allah and is, further, not distracted by his wealth andchildren from migrating and taking part in jihad.
64|16|(So keep your duty to Allah) so obey Allah (as best ye can) to the best of your ability, (and listen) to whatyou are commanded with, (and obey) the commands of Allah and His Messenger, (and spend) and give almsin the way of Allah; (that is better for your souls) He says: giving alms is better than withholding wealth.(And whoso is saved from his own greed) whoever drives away from himself his own greed; and it is alsosaid this means: whoever gives the poor-due entitled in his wealth, (such are the successful) who escapeAllah's wrath and torment.
64|17|(If ye lend unto Allah) by giving alms (a goodly loan) sincerely from your hearts and intending with it no onebut Allah, (He will double it for you) He will accept it and multiply it from seven to 70 and up two millionsfolds, and up to whatever He wills (and will forgive you) through your alms, (for Allah is Responsive) in thatHe accepts your alms and multiplies it manifold; it is also said that this means: He is thankful: He acceptsvery little from His salves and rewards for it abundantly, (Clement) He does not hasten His punishment uponthose who boast about their almsgiving and those who refuse to give alms,
64|18|(Knower of the invisible) i.e. that which is in the hearts of those who give alms of the feelings of boastingand fear (and the visible) He is Aware of their alms, (the Mighty) in retribution against those who boastabout their alms or refuse to give alms, (the Wise) in His command and decree; it is also said that thismeans: the Wise in accepting alms and multiplying the reward of almsgiving; and it is also said this means:the Wise in that He enjoined His Messenger (pbuh) and his nation to divorce in accordance with theprophetic practice'.
65|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (OProphet!): '(O Prophet!) And this includes his community. (When ye (men) put away women) He says: tellyour people, when you want to divorce women, (put them away for their (legal) period) divorce them whenthey become pure from their menses and they have not had sexual intercourse with them (and reckon theperiod) reckon their periods of purity following three periods of menstruation which are followed by majorritual ablution which, for this denotes the end of the waiting period (and keep your duty to Allah) and fearAllah, (your Lord) and do not divorce them when they are not ritually pure, as this goes against theprophetic practice. (Expel them not from their houses) where the divorce has taken place until the waitingperiod is over (nor let them go forth) until the elapse of the waiting period (unless they commit openimmorality) unless they commit an evident sin, i.e. going out during the waiting period without herhusbands' permission. Thus, expelling them from their homes during the waiting period is a sin and theirgoing out in their waiting period is also a sin; it is also said that (unless they commit open immorality)means: unless they commit an act of adultery witnessed by four people, in which case they should bestoned. (Such are the limits (imposed by) Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah aboutwomen regarding expenditure and lodgement; (and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) and whoevertransgresses Allah's legal rulings and obligations and that which He has commanded regarding expenditureand lodgement, (he verily wrongeth his soul) he harms his own person. (Thou knowest not) i.e. the husbanddoes not know: (it may be that Allah will afterward) after the first pronouncement of divorce and before theend of the waiting period (bring some new thing to pass) i.e. love between the husband and wife and returnto each other.
65|2|(Then, when they have reached their term) when the waiting period is over, before having major ritualablution, after the end of the third period of menstruation, (take them back in kindness) before they havemajor ritual ablution after the third period of menstruation, and then they should be treated with kindness(or part from them in kindness) do not prolong their waiting period, and give them all their rights, (and callto witness) both for divorcing them and taking them back (two just men among you) two free, upright,Muslim men, (and keep your testimony upright for Allah) and give your testimony before the judges forAllah's sake. (Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last) resurrection after death (is exhorted) believes (to actthus) i.e. regarding the expenditure, lodgement and delivering testimony. It is said that from the beginningof the surah up to here was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) when he divorced Hafsah, and also about sixprophetic Companions, among whom was Ibn 'Umar, who divorced their wives when they were in theirperiods, and so Allah forbade them from doing so, because it does not comply with the prophetic practice ofdivorce, and taught them about the latter. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) upon committing atransgression and remain steadfast, (Allah will appoint a way out for him) from hardship; it is also said thatthis means: He will appoint a way out for him from transgression to acts of obedience; it is also said thismeans: from the Fire into Paradise,
65|3|(And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) this was revealed about 'Awf IbnMalik al-Ashja'i whose son was captured by the enemy, and who returned later on to his family bringing withhim many camels. (And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah) and whoever relies on Allah regardingprovision, (He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His command to pass) His command and decree will cometo pass in times of both comfort and hardship; it is also said this means: His command and providence willcome to pass. (Allah hath set a measure) an appointed term (for all things) for both comfort and hardship.When Allah explained the waiting period of women who are divorced, Mu'adh stood up and said: "OMessenger of Allah! What is the waiting period for those women who despair of menstruation?"
65|4|(And for such of your women as despair of menstruation) because of old age, (if ye doubt) about theirwaiting period, (their period (of waiting) shall be three months) upon which another man asked: "OMessenger of Allah! What about the waiting period of those who do not have menstruation because they aretoo young?" (along with those who have it not) because of young age, their waiting period is three months.Another man asked: "what is the waiting period for those women who are pregnant?" (And for those withchild) i.e. those who are pregnant, (their period) their waiting period (shall be till they bring forth theirburden) their child. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) and whoever fears Allah regarding what hecommands him, (He maketh his course easy for him) He makes his matter easy; and it is also said thismeans: He will help him to worship Him well.
65|5|(That is the commandment of Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah (which He revealethunto you) which He explains to you in the Qur'an. (And whoso keepeth his duty to Allah) and whoever fearsAllah regarding what He commands him, (He will remit from him his evil deeds) He will forgive his sins (andmagnify reward for him) in the Garden.
65|6|Allah then went back to the subject of divorcees and said: (Lodge them) lodge the women you divorce(where ye dwell) wherever you live, (according to your wealth) you provide expenditure and lodgement,(and harass them not) do not harass the women you divorce regarding expenditure and lodgement (so as tostraiten life for them) and thus wrong them. (And if they are with child) and if the women you divorce arepregnant, (then spend for them) i.e. the husbands should spend for them (till they bring forth their burden)until they give birth to their child. (Then, if they give suck for you) if the mother breastfeeds a child of yours,(give them) i.e. the mothers (their due payment) for breastfeeding (and consult together in kindness) thehusband should spend on the mother without stinginess or spendthriftness; (but if ye make difficulties forone another) i.e. regarding expenditure and the mother refuses to breastfeed the child, (then let some otherwoman give suck for him (the father of the child)) then another woman, other than the mother, should besought to breastfeed the child.
65|7|(Let him) i.e. the father, (who hath abundance) who is well off (spend of his abundance) according to hiswealth, (and he whose provision is measured) and he whose livelihood is tight, (let him spend) onbreastfeeding (of that which Allah hath given him) according to what Allah has given him. (Allah askethnaught of any soul) regarding payment for breastfeeding (save that which He hath given it) save accordingto what he has given it of wealth. (Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship) in expenditure, (ease) after povertythere will be richness, for the one who suffers hardship of living awaits provision from Allah.
65|8|(And how many a community) how many people of a community (revolted against the ordinance of its Lord)transgressed and refused to obey the commands of their Lord (and His messenger) and rejected themessengers and the messages they brought to them, (and we called it to a stern account) in the Hereafter(and punished it) in the life of the world (with dire punishment) with severe punishment,
65|9|(So that it tasted the ill effects of its conduct) it tasted the punishment of its course in the life of the worldthrough being destroyed, (and the consequence of its conduct) in the Hereafter (was loss) will be loss.
65|10|(Allah hath prepared for them) in the Hereafter (stern punishment) an intense punishment, one kind ofpunishment after the other; (so keep your duty to Allah) so fear Allah, (O men of understanding) O you whopossess intellect among people! (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Now Allah hathsent down unto you a reminder) a reminder with the Messenger,
65|11|(A messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (reciting unto you the revelations of Allah) the Qur'an (made plain)making clear the commands and prohibitions, (that He may bring forth those who believe) in Muhammad(pbuh) and the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts of obedience, secretly between them and their Lord(from darkness unto light) from disbelief to faith. (And whosoever believeth in Allah) and Muhammad (pbuh)and the Qur'an, (and doeth right) sincerely between himself and his Lord, (He will bring him) in theHereafter (into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) river of wine, water,honey and milk flow, (therein to abide for ever) they will dwell in the Garden, never to die or leave. (Allahhath made good provision for him) Allah has prepared a reward for him in Paradise.
65|12|(Allah it is Who hath created seven heavens) one above the other like a dome, (and of the earth the likethereof) seven earths but they are flat. (The commandment cometh down among them slowly) He says: Hesends the angels down from heaven with revelation, Scripture and calamities, (that ye may know) andacknowledge (that Allah is Able to do all things) relating to the dwellers of the heavens and the earths, (andthat Allah surroundeth all things in knowledge) and that His knowledge encompasses everything'.
66|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (O Prophet!): '(O Prophet!) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh). (Why bannest thou that which Allah hath madelawful for thee) i.e. marrying Maria the Copt, the Mother of Ibrahim; that is because he had forbiddenhimself from marrying her, (seeking to please thy wives) seeking the pleasure of your wives 'A'ishah andHafsah by forbidding yourself from marrying Maria the Copt? (And Allah is Forgiving) He forgives you,(Merciful) about that oath.
66|2|(Allah hath made lawful for you (Muslims) absolution from your oaths (of such a kind)) and so the Prophet(pbuh) absolved himself from his oath and married Maria the Copt, (and Allah is your Protector) and Helper.(He is the Knower) He knows that you forbade yourself Maria the Copt, (the Wise) in that which He enjoinedabout the expiation of oaths.
66|3|(When the Prophet confided a fact unto one of his wives) i.e. Hafsah (and when she afterward divulged it)Hafsah divulged to 'A'ishah what the Prophet (pbuh) told her in confidence (and Allah apprised him thereof)and Allah informed him that Hafsah informed 'A'ishah, (he made known (to her) part thereof) part of whatshe said to 'A'ishah regarding the leadership of Abu Bakr and 'Umar; and it is said: about seeing Maria theCopt on his own (and passed over part) he did not mention making forbidding Maria the Copt on himself norwhat he told her concerning the leadership of Abu Bakr and 'Umar after him, for he did not reproach him forthis. (And when he told it her) when the Prophet (pbuh) informed Hafsah about what she said to 'A'ishah(she said) Hafsah said: (Who hath told thee) that I informed 'A'ishah? (He said) the Prophet (pbuh) said:(The Knower, the Aware hath told me) what you divulged to 'A'ishah.
66|4|(If ye twain turn unto Allah repentant) if you two, i.e. Hafsah and 'A'ishah, repent of hurting and disobeyingthe Prophet (pbuh) ((ye have cause to do so) for your hearts desired (the ban)) for your hearts havedeviated from the Truth; (and if ye aid one another against him (Muhammad)) but if you help one anotherto harm and disobey him (then lo! Allah, even He, is his protecting Friend) then Allah is his Protector andHelper against you, (and Gabriel) will help him against you (and the righteous among the believers) all truebelievers are helpers to him against you: Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman, 'Ali, may Allah be well pleased with, andall other true believers; (and furthermore the angels are his helpers) and the angels are with all these hishelpers against you.
66|5|(It may happen) and this will surely happen (that his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your steadwives better than you) in obedience, (submissive (to Allah)) by stating it openly, (believing) true in theirfaith both with their tongues and hearts, (pious) obedient to Allah and to their husband, (penitent) fromtheir sins, (inclined to fasting, widows) like Asiyah Bint Muzahim, the wife of Pharaoh (and maids) like Marydaughter of Amran, the mother of Jesus.
66|6|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Ward off from yourselves) and your folks (andyour families) and wives and children (a Fire) He says: teach them good manners and make them learngoodness, and by doing so you will save them from the Fire (whereof the fuel is men and stones) of sulphurwhich is the hottest of stones, (over which) over the Fire (are set angels) i.e. the angels in charge of the Fire(strong) huge, (severe) very strong, (who resist not Allah in that which He commandeth them) regarding thechastisement of the dwellers of the Fire, (but do) i.e. the angels in charge of the Fire (that which they arecommanded.
66|7|(Then it will be said): O ye who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Make no excuses foryourselves this day) for your excuses will not be accepted. (Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do)and say in the life of the world.
66|8|(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance!) repent ofyour sins truly and sincerely from the bottom of your hearts. This means feeling regret in one's heart, askingforgiveness with one's tongue and stop engaging in the particular sin one is repenting of with one's bodyand conscience, intending never to return to it (It may be) "may be" from Allah denotes a necessity (thatyour Lord will remit from you your evil deeds) forgive your sins through repentance (and bring you) in theHereafter (into Gardens beneath which) beneath their trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine,water, honey and milk flow, (on the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when Allah will not abase theProphet) as He abases the disbelievers; He says: He will not torment the Prophet (pbuh) (and those whobelieve with him) and will not torment those who believe in him, such as Abu Bakr and his believingbrothers. (Their light will run) will shine (before them) on the Bridge over the Fire (and on their right hands:they will say) when the light of the hypocrites is put out: (Our Lord! Perfect our light for us) on the Bridgeover hell, (and forgive us) our sins! (Lo! Thou art Able to do all things) of completing our light and forgivingus.
66|9|(O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca with the sword until they accept faith(and the hypocrites) of Medina with your tongue by rebuking and threatening them, (and be stern withthem) and be hard in words and deeds with both parties. (Hell will be their home) the destination of thedisbelievers and hypocrites will be the Fire, (a hapless journey's end) is Gehenna wherein they will end up.
66|10|Allah warned 'A'ishah and Hafsah because they hurt the Prophet (pbuh) by mentioning the example of thewives of Noah and Lot, saying: (Allah citeth) Allah explains (an example) a trait (for those who disbelieve)by mentioning the two disbelieving women: (the wife of Noah) Wahilah (and the wife of Lot) Wa'ilah, (whowere under two of our righteous slaves) messengers (yet betrayed them) yet opposed them in religion,displaying belief outwardly while hiding their disbelief inwardly, such that they kept their hypocrisy in theirhearts; but they did not betray their husbands in the sense that they committed adultery, for no wife of aprophet had ever done this, (so that they the husbands availed them naught) benefited them naught(against Allah) against the chastisement of Allah; i.e. the righteousness of their husbands did not benefitthem while they were disbelievers (and it was said (unto them): Enter the Fire) in the Hereafter (along withthose who enter) the Fire.
66|11|Allah then encouraged them to repent and be good and follow the example of Asiyah Bint Muzahim andMary daughter of Amran, saying: (And Allah citeth an example) Allah explained the trait to be followed (forthose who believe) giving the example of two Muslim women: (the wife of Pharaoh) Asiyah Bint Muzahim(when she said) regarding Pharaoh's torture of her: (My Lord! Build for me a home with Thee in the Garden)so that Pharaoh's torture becomes bearable for me, (and deliver me from Pharaoh) from the religion ofPharaoh (and his work) and his torture, (and deliver me from evil doing folk) the disbelievers. Thus thedisbelief of her husband did not harm her because of her faith and sincerity;
66|12|(And Mary, daughter of Imran, whose body was chaste, therefore We breathed therein something of OurSpirit) and so Gabriel breathed inside her garment and she became pregnant with Jesus. (And she put faithin the words of her Lord) she believed in what Gabriel told her that he was the Messenger of Allah entrustedwith giving her a holy son (and His Scriptures) and she also believed in His Scriptures: the Torah, the Gospeland all other Scriptures; it is also said this means: she believed in the words of her Lord that Jesus the sonof Mary will come into being by Allah saying "Be!" and he became a human being, and she also believed inHis Scripture: the Gospel, (and was of the obedient) in times of hardship and comfort; and it is also said thatthis means: and she was obedient to He Who is far transcendent and majestic'.
67|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Blessed is He): '(Blessed is He) He says: He possesses grace; it is also said this means: exalted,transcendent, exonerated is He, and He is too holy to have children or partners (in Whose hand is theSovereignty) the power to bestow might and abasement and the power over the stores of all things, (and Heis Able to do all things) to elevate or to abase.
67|2|(Who hath created life) resembling a white-and-black female horse which does not pass by, step on, or issmelled by a thing except that that thing becomes alive. This beast is smaller than a mule and bigger thanan ass, one gallop can transport it as far as it can see. It is used as a means of travel by the prophets; (anddeath) resembling a ram whose wool is a mixture of white and black. This ram does not pass by, step on, oris smelled by, any thing except that that thing dies. It is also said that (He created death) means: Hecreated the sperm drop; and (created life) means: He created the living being; (that He may try you)between life and death, (which of you is best in conduct) which of you is more sincere in works; (and He isthe Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (Forgiving) He forgives those who repent andbelieve in Him,
67|3|(Who hath created seven heavens in harmony) each one securely resting above the other, like a domewhose extremities are cemented with each other. (Thou) O Muhammad (canst see no fault) no crookedness(in the Beneficent One's creation) in the creation of the heavens; (then look again) at the sky: (Canst thousee any rifts) cracks, cleaves, defects or faults?
67|4|(Then look again and yet again) at the sky and reflect, (your sight will return unto thee weakened and madedim) before you see anything.
67|5|(And verily We have beatified the world's heaven) the first heaven (with lamps) with stars, (and We havemade them) i.e. the stars (missiles for the devils) such that some of them become bewitched, some arekilled while others are burnt, (and for them) for the devils (We have prepared) in the Hereafter (the doom offlame.

67|8|As it would burst with rage) towards the disbelievers. (Whenever a (fresh) host) of disbelievers, i.e. theJews, Christians, Magians and all other disbelievers (flung therein) in Gehenna (the wardens thereof) thewardens of Gehenna (ask them: Came there unto you no warner) a warning messenger?
67|9|(They say: Yea, verily, a warner) a warning messenger (came unto us; but we denied) the messengers (andsaid: Allah hath naught revealed) Allah has not revealed any Scripture nor has He sent any messenger to us;(ye are in naught) and we said to the messengers: you are in nothing (but a great error) ascribing partnersto Allah; it is also said that the wardens of Gehenna will say to the disbelievers: when you were in the life ofthe world: you were in nothing but great error, i.e. idolatry.
67|10|(And they say) to the wardens: (Had we been wont to listen) to the Truth and guidance (or have sense) ordesired the Truth in the life of the world, (we had not been among the dwellers in the flames) in Gehennatoday.
67|11|(So they acknowledge their sins) they acknowledge their idolatry; (but far removed) from Allah's mercy andbanished (are the dwellers in the flames) in the Fire today.
67|12|(Lo! those who fear their Lord) those who work for their Lord (in secret) even though they do not see Him,(theirs will be forgiveness) of their sins in the life of the world (and a great reward) in the Garden.
67|13|(And keep your opinion secret) about Muhammad (pbuh) through your treachery and betrayal (or proclaimit) through war and fighting, (lo! He is Knower of all that is in the breasts (of men)) He is the Knower ofwhat is in people's hearts of good and evil.

(And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the dead)) andunto Him is the return after death.
67|16|(Have ye taken security) by your transgression, O people of Mecca, (from Him Who is in the heaven) fromthe chastisement of He Who is in Heaven established on the Throne (that He will not cause the earth toswallow you when lo! it is convulsed) swirling with you to the seventh earth, just as it has swallowed Korah?

68|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Nun): '(Nun) He says: Allah swears by the Nun, which is the whale that carries the earths on its backwhile in Water, and beneath which is the Bull and under the Bull is the Rock and under the Rock is the Dustand none knows what is under the Dust save Allah. The name of the whale is Liwash, and it is said its nameis Lutiaya'; the name of the bull is Bahamut, and some say its name is Talhut or Liyona. The whale is in asea called 'Adwad, and it is like a small bull in a huge sea. The sea is in a hollowed rock whereby there is4,000 cracks, and from each crack water springs out to the earth. It is also said that Nun is one of thenames of the Lord; it stands for the letter Nun in Allah's name al-Rahman (the Beneficent); and it is alsosaid that a Nun is an inkwell. (By the pen) Allah swore by the pen. This pen is made of light and its height isequal to the distance between Heaven and earth. It is with this pen that the Wise Remembrance, i.e. theGuarded Tablet, was written. It is also said that the pen is one of the angels by whom Allah has sworn, (andthat which they write (therewith)) and Allah also swore by what the angels write down of the works of thechildren of Adam,
68|2|(Thou art not) O Muhammad, (for your Lord's favour) for the prophethood and Islam bestowed (unto thee,a madman) bewitched. This is the reason why Allah made the above oath.

68|4|(And lo! thou art) O Muhammad (of a tremendous nature) following a noble religion which is honoured byAllah; it is also said this means: you have great character traits with which Allah has honoured you.

68|8|(Therefore obey not thou) O Muhammad (the rejecters) the disbelievers in Allah, His Scripture and HisMessenger, i.e. the leaders of the people of Mecca

68|10|(Neither obey thou) O Muhammad (each feeble) with regard to the religion of Allah (oath monger) who liesagainst Allah. This refers to al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi,

68|12|(Hinderer of the good) hinderer of Islam, for he prevented his sons and relatives from embracing Islam,(transgressor) he transgressed, O Muhammad, against the Truth and wronged them, (malefactor) sinful
68|13|(Greedy therewithal) he eats and drinks much and has a strong body and a large belly; it is also said thatthis means: he is extreme in arguing in favour of falsehood and lies, (intrusive) he is stuck with the folkwhile he is not of them; it is also said that this means: he is well known for his disbelief, idolatry, indecency,sinfulness and evil; it is also said that this means: he is known for his meanness just as a young donkey isknown to have a pendant on its ear.
68|14|(It is because he is possessed of wealth and children) He says: do not obey him even if he has wealth andchildren. This man had 9,000 measures of silver and ten children
68|15|(That, when Our revelations) the Qur'an, detailing the commands and prohibitions (are recited unto him, hesaith: Mere fables of the men of old) this is just the talk and lies of the men of old.

68|17|(Lo! we have tried them) We have tried the people of Mecca with death, captivity and defeat on the Day ofBadr because they refrained from asking forgiveness and We tried them with hunger and drought for aperiod of seven years because the Prophet, Allah bless him and give peace, prayed against them on the Dayof Badr (as We tried) with hunger and the burning of the gardens (the owners of the garden) the owners ofthe fields: the Banu Darwan (when they vowed) when they swore by Allah (they would pluck its fruit nextmorning) at the break of dawn.
68|18|(And made no exception (for the will of Allah)) they forgot to say: Allah willing;
68|19|(Then a visitation) a punishment from your Lord (came upon it) upon the garden (while they slept) and wasburned.
68|20|(And in the morning it was as if plucked) it was like a dark night.
68|21|(And they cried out one unto another in the morning) at the break of dawn,
68|22|(Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit)) before the needy ones come to know about it.
68|23|(So they went off) towards the fields, (saying one unto another in low tones:
68|24|No needy man shall enter it) i.e. the garden (today against you.
68|25|They went betimes) they went to their fields holding rancour, (strong in (this) purpose) to pluck their fruits.
68|26|(But when they saw it) when they saw the fields burned down, (they said: Lo! we are in error!) we havetaken a wrong turn; thinking that they were not their fields
68|27|Then they said: (Nay, but we are desolate!) We have been denied the benefit of the garden because of ourill intentions.
68|28|(The best among them) in intellect and opinion; and it is also said this means: the older one of them; and itis also said: the most upright among them (said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah)) why notsay: Allah willing? He said this when they made their vow.
68|29|(They said: Glorified be our Lord!) We ask forgiveness of our Lord. (Lo! we have been wrong-doers) weharmed ourselves by our transgression and intention to deprive the needy ones and also by failing to say"Allah willing".
68|30|(Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching) reproaching one another.
68|31|(They said) in unison: (Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous) we were sinful by depriving the needyones.

68|33|(Such was the punishment) in the life of the world for the one who refrains from giving Allah's due from hiswealth, just as Allah burnt their garden and exposed them to hunger; it is also said that this means: such isthe punishment of the life of the world as happened to the people of Mecca who were exposed to hungerand death. (And verily the punishment of the Hereafter) for he who does not repent (is greater) than thepunishment of the life of the world (if they did but know) if the people of Mecca did but knew, but they donot know nor do they believe in this.
68|34|(Lo! for those who keep from evil) for those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (are Gardens ofBliss) whose bliss is continuous and eternal (with their Lord) in the Hereafter.

(And they had been summoned) in the life of the world (to prostrate themselves) tosubmit themselves through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness but did not submit to Allah's divineOneness (while they were yet unhurt) while they were strong and sound of bodies.
68|44|(Leave Me) O Muhammad ((to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement) to this Scripture.(We shall lead them on) i.e. those who mock the Qur'an (by steps from whence they know not) fromwhence they perceive not.

70|5|(But be patient) O Muhammad, in the face of their harm (with a patience fair to see) i.e. without anguish ordisplay of indecency; and it is also said this means: stay away from them and show no anguish or indecency.Later, he was commanded to fight them.

70|7|(While We behold it nigh) it will happen, for whatever will happen in the future is near:
70|8|Allah then explained when they will be chastised, saying: (The day when the sky will become as moltencopper) and it is said: like the sediments of olive oil,
70|9|(And the hills become as flakes of wool,
70|10|And no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend) no relative will ask about his relative
70|11|(Though they will be given sight of them) but will not recognise them as a result of their preoccupation withtheir own selves. (The guilty man) the idolater, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host; and it is said: al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his host (will long be able to ransom himself from the punishment of that day) the Day ofJudgement (at the price of his children

70|15|(But nay!) truly this will not deliver him from the punishment-this is an answer to him-(for lo! it is the fire ofhell
70|16|Eager to roast) the entire body; it is also said that this means: it will pluck out the hands and feet as well asall the other members of the body;
70|17|(It calleth) to itself: "come to me, O disbeliever!", "come to me, O hypocrite" (him who turned) from Allah'sdivine Oneness (and fled) from faith and did not repent of disbelief,
70|18|(And hoarded (wealth)) in the life of the world (and withheld it) he put it in a container and refused to givethe right of Allah which is due from it.
70|19|(Lo! Man) i.e. the disbelieving person (was created anxious) miserly, too attached and tight-fisted,
70|20|(Fretful) he is not patient (when evil befalleth him) when poverty and hardship befall him
70|21|(And, when good) wealth and abundance (befalleth him, grudging) he does not give thanks and withholdsthe right of Allah which is due from it;
70|22|(Save worshippers) those who pray the five daily prayers for they are not like this.
70|23|Allah then explained the traits of the latter, saying: (Who are constant at their worship) they constantlyperform their prescribed daily prayers, whether it is at night or in the day, and they never fail to performthem.
70|24|(And in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged) they acknowledge that there is in their wealth a rightother than the prescribed poor-due,
70|25|(For the beggar) who ask you to give him from your wealth (and the destitute) who is denied his wage orbooty; it is also said that this refers to the artisan whose skill does not earn him enough for him to subsist; itis also said that this refers to the poor who does not beg from others and as a result no one gives or knowsabout him;
70|26|(And those who believe in the Day of Judgement) and those who believe in the Day of Reckoning and allthat which is in it,
70|27|(And those who are fearful of their Lord's doom
70|28|Lo! the doom of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure) no guarantee of security has come tothem from their Lord.
70|29|(And those who preserve their chastity) they are chaste as far as what is unlawful is concerned
70|30|(Save with their) four (wives and those whom their right hands possess) of slaves without limitation, (forthus they are not blameworthy) nor sinful; they are not reproached for indulging in that which is lawful;
70|31|(But whoso seeketh more than that) whoever seeks more than what I have mentioned of wives and slaves,(those are they who are transgressors) from that which is lawful to that which is unlawful;
70|32|(And those who keep) and those who honour, and keep to the time agreed upon regarding (their pledges)that with which they have been entrusted whether it relates to religion or other things (and their covenant)with their Lord or with other people; and it is also said this means: and their oaths.
70|33|(And those who stand by their testimony) before the judges when they are called to give witness, and donot refuse to testify,
70|34|(And those who are attentive at their worship) they observe the prescribed times of their five daily prayers,
70|35|(These) those who have such traits (will dwell in Gardens, honoured) with reward, presents and gifts.
70|36|(What aileth those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca who mock the believers as well as the otherdisbelievers, (that they keep staring towards thee (O Muhammad)) around you, (open eyed) looking at youwithout coming close to you,
70|37|Dispersed (On the right and on the left, in groups?
70|38|Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight?) This is an answer from Allah to thedisbelievers that He will not let them enter the Garden.
70|39|(Nay, verily. Lo! We created them) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (from what they know) i.e. a sperm drop.
70|40|(But nay! I swear by the Lord of the rising places) the rising places of winter and summer (and the settingplaces of the planets) the setting places of winter and summer. There are two rising places and two settingplaces. The rising place of winter and summer has 177 phases and so do the setting places of winter andsummer. The sun rises, in a year, two days in the same phase, and it also sets, in a year, two days in thesame phase (that We are Able) this is the reason of the above oath
70|41|(To replace them by (others) better than them) He says: We are Able to destroy them and replace themwith others who are better and more obedient than them. (And We are not to be outrun) We are unable toreplace them with others who are better than them.
70|42|(So let them) O Muhammad, i.e. let those who mock you and the other disbelievers (chat) about falsehood(and play) and mock you while continuing to be disbelievers (until they meet) until they behold (their Daywhich they are promised) in which they are promised chastisement,
70|43|Allah then explained when this chastisement will take place, saying: (The day when they come forth fromthe graves in haste) in response to the sound (as racing to a goal) or a banner,
70|44|(With eyes) that see no goodness (aghast) humiliated, (abasement stupefying them) grief and darknessappear on their faces: (Such is the Day which they are promised) such is the Day in which they werepromised chastisement; and this day is the Day of Judgement. And this promise is like the promise andwarning of Noah'.
71|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Lo! We sent): '(Lo! We sent Noah unto his people (saying): Warn your people) from Allah's wrathand punishment (ere the painful doom come unto them) in the form of drowning.
71|2|(He said: O my people! Lo! I am a plain warner unto you) I am a warning messenger unto you, addressingyou in a language you understand.
71|3|((Bidding you): Serve Allah) declare Allah's divine Oneness (and keep your duty unto Him) fear Him andrepent of disbelief and idolatry (and obey me) and follow my matter, religion and counsel and accept myadvice to you,
71|4|(That He may forgive you somewhat of your sins) He will forgive your sins through your repentance andbelief in Allah's divine Oneness (and respite you) without sending a punishment on you (to an appointedterm) until you die. (Lo! the term of Allah) the torment of Allah, (when it cometh, cannot be delayed, if yebut knew) if you believe in what I say to you.
71|5|When he despaired of them, after calling them to faith for 950 years, and they refused to believe or heed hisadvice, (He said: My Lord! Lo! I have called unto my people) to repent and believe in Allah's divine Oneness(night and day) at night and during the day.
71|6|(But all my calling) to them to repent and believe in Allah's divine Oneness (doth but add to theirrepugnance) does but increase their remoteness from faith and repentance;
71|7|(And lo! Whenever I call unto them) to repentance and belief in Allah's divine Oneness (that Thou maystpardon them) through their repentance and faith in Allah's divine Oneness (they thrust their fingers in theirears) so as not to hear my words and invitation (and cover themselves with their garments) and cover theirheads with their garments so that they do not hear my voice or see me (and persist (in their refusal)) andthey remain firm in their disbelief and worship of idols; it is also said that they all shouted in unison: "ONoah! We will not believe in you", (and magnify themselves in pride) and feel too proud to accept faith orrepent, because of their arrogance.
71|8|(And lo! I have called unto them) to repent and believe in Allah's divine Oneness (aloud) openly, thusavoiding secrecy,
71|9|(And lo! I have made public proclamation unto them) I called them openly to the message and explained tothem, (and I have appealed to them in private) and I called them secretly to the message.
71|10|(And I have said) to them: (Seek pardon of your Lord) declare the divine Oneness of your Lord and repentof disbelief and idolatry. (Lo! He was ever Forgiving) of those who repent of disbelief and believe in Him.
71|11|(He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain) whenever you need rain. This is because Allah hadwithheld rain from them for 40 years,
71|12|(And will help you with wealth) camels, bovines, sheep (and sons) and daughters; this is because Allah hadstopped their wives and beasts from conceiving for 40 years, (and will assign unto you Gardens and willassign unto you rivers) flowing rivers for your own benefits. This is because Allah had, before this, destroyedtheir fields and made their rivers dry for 40 years.
71|13|(What aileth you that ye hope not towards Allah for dignity) what ails you that you do not fear Allah's mightand majesty; and it is also said that this means: what ails you that you do not magnify Allah as He deservesto be magnified and, thus, believe in His divine Oneness.
71|14|(When He created you by (diverse) stages?) The stages refer to sperm drops, blood clots, small chunks offlesh and bones, etc.,
71|15|(See ye not) have you not been informed, O disbelievers of Mecca, (how Allah hath created seven heavensin harmony) He created them one above the other like a dome whose different parts are cemented witheach other,
71|16|(And hath made the moon) along with them (a light therein) a shining light therein, (and made the sun alamp) a radiance for the children of Adam?
71|17|(And Allah hath caused you to grow as a growth from the earth) He created you from Adam, and Adam iscreated from dust and the dust is from the earth,
71|18|(And afterward He maketh you return thereto) He will burry you in the earth, (and He will bring you forthagain) from the graves on the Day of Judgement, (a (new) forthbringing.

71|21|(Noah said: My Lord!) O my Lord! (They have disobeyed me) regarding repentance and faith in Allah's divineOneness (and followed) and obeyed (one whose) abundant (wealth and children increase him in naughtsave ruin) in the Hereafter; this refers to the chieftains of his folk;
71|22|(And they have plotted a mighty plot) and they have uttered a tremendous lie,

(Forsake not Wadd) forsake not the worship of Wadd, (nor Suwa') northe worship of Suwa', (nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr) nor the worship of Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr.These were idols which Noah's folk worshipped.
71|24|(And they have led many astray) he says: they have misled through them many people; and it is also said:many people went astray because of them, (and Thou increasest the wrong-doers) the disbelievers andidolaters in their worship of these idols (in naught save error) loss and destruction.
71|25|(Because of their sins they were drowned) by the flood in the life of the world, (then made to enter) in theHereafter (a Fire. And they found they had no helpers in place of Allah) they had no helpers to defend themagainst Allah's chastisement.
71|26|(And Noah said) after Allah told him that none of his people will believe in him, apart from those who hadalready believed: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land.

71|28|(My Lord!) O my Lord! (Forgive me and my parents) and forgive my believing parents (and him whoentereth my house) my religion; and it is also said: my mosque; and it is also said: my ship (believing, andbelieving men and believing women) who are true in their faith and who will come after me, (and increasenot the wrong-doers) the disbelieving idolaters (in aught save ruin) loss and destruction, like the destructionof those people whose Prophet received the revelation but refused to believe in him'.
72|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me): '(Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me) say, OMuhammad, to the disbelievers of Mecca that Gabriel has come down and informed me (that a company ofthe jinn) nine of the jinn of Nusaybin which is near Yemen (gave ear, and they said) after accepting faithand returning to their folk: O our folk! (Lo! it is a marvellous Qur'an) we have listened to the recitation of amarvellous, illustrious and noble Qur'an which resembles the Scripture of Moses, this is because they werefollowers of the Torah,
72|2|(Which guideth unto righteousness) which guides to the Truth, guidance and right course, i.e. to "there is nodeity except Allah", (so we believe in it) we believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and we believe in the Qur'an (andwe ascribe unto our Lord no partner) here meaning the devil.
72|3|(And (we believe) that He-exalted be the glory of our Lord-) and that the dominion of our Lord is exalted; itis also said this means: the tremendousness, sovereignty, absoluteness and attributes of our Lord are farexalted, and He (hath taken neither wife nor son) as the disbelievers claim,
72|4|(And that the foolish one among us) i.e. the devil (used to speak concerning Allah an atrocious lie.
72|5|And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie concerning Allah) and we thoughtthat what humans and the jinn said about Allah was not a lie, but we know now that it is. From thebeginning of the surah up to here, Allah related what the jinn said.
72|6|Allah then said: (And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the protection ofindividuals of the jinn so that they increased them) because of that (in revolt (against Allah)) in pride,arrogance, sedition, and corruption. This is because they were afraid of them whenever they travelled,caught a game or camped in a valley. And to avoid their harm they used to say: "we seek refuge in themaster of this valley from the foolish ones of his folk" after which they felt safe. As a result, the masters ofthese places increased in nothing but pride and arrogance towards the communality among their folk. Thereare three kinds of jinn: one kind flies in the air; another kind ascends and descends wherever they wish; anda third kind resembles dogs and snakes;
72|7|(And indeed they) the disbelievers of the jinn before they accepted faith (supposed, even as you suppose) Opeople of Mecca, (that Allah would not raise anyone (from the dead)) and it is also said that this means: andthey supposed just as you did that Allah will not send anyone as a messenger.
72|8|Allah then went back to the talk of the jinn, saying: (And (the jinn who had listened to the Qur'an said): Wehad sought the heaven) before we accepted faith (but had found it filled with strong warders) angels (andmeteors) preventing them from listening.
72|9|(And we used to sit on places (high) therein) in heaven (to listen) before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh).(But he who listened now) after the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) (findeth a flame) a shining star (in waitfor him) from the angels in order to prevent them from listening;
72|10|(And we know not whether) in preventing us from listening (harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, orwhether their Lord intendeth guidance for them) or whether their Lord intends guidance, goodness and thecorrect course for them; it is also said that this means: we do not know whether evil is intended for thepeople of the earth by the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such that if they do not believe in him they will bedestroyed or it is good, guidance and the correct course that their Lord intends for them if they believe inhim.
72|11|(And among us there are righteous folk) those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness; these are those whobelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and among us there are far from that) and among us thereare disbelievers, the disbelieving jinn. (We are sects having different rules) we followed different religions,i.e. Judaism and Christianity, before believing in Allah.
72|12|(And we know) and are certain (that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth) for He can reach uswherever we might be, (nor can we escape by flight) nor can we escape from Him by running away.
72|13|(And when we heard the guidance) and when we heard the recitation of the Qur'an by Muhammad (pbuh)(we believed therein) we believed in the Qur'an and Muhammad (pbuh) (and whoso believeth in his Lord, hefeareth neither loss) of all his works (nor oppression) nor decrease of his works.
72|14|(And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah)) and there are among us those who aresincere in their belief in Allah's divine Oneness; these are the ones who believed in Muhammad (pbuh) andthe Qur'an (and there are among us some who are unjust) i.e. disobedient ones who have deviated from theTruth and guidance; and these are the disbelievers among the jinn. (And whoso hath surrendered to Allah)and whoever is sincere in his belief in Allah's divine Oneness, (such have taken the right path purposefully)such have intended goodness and the correct course.
72|15|(And as for those who are unjust) i.e. the disbelievers, (they are firewood for hell.
72|16|If they (the idolaters) tread the right path) the path of disbelief; and it is said: the path of Islam, (We shallgive them to drink of water in abundance) We shall give them abundant wealth and a comfortable life
72|17|(That We may test them thereby) in order that they may revert to that which I have ordained for them, (andwhoso turneth away from the remembrance of his Lord) and whoever turns away from believing in thedivine Oneness and Scripture of his Lord, i.e. the Qur'an-this refers to al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi;(He will thrust him into ever growing torment) climbing a mountain of smooth stones; and it is said thismeans: climbing a mountain of copper in the Fire.
72|18|(And the places of worship are only for Allah) they are built for the remembrance of Allah, (so pray not unto)so worship not (anyone along with Allah) in mosques; it is also said that the places of worship refer to thedifferent parts of a person that touch the ground upon prostrating in prayer: the forehead, the knees, thehands and the feet.
72|19|(And when the slave of Allah) Muhammad (pbuh) (stood up) in Batn Nakhl (in prayer to Him) to worshipAllah through prayer, (they crowded on him, almost stifling) the jinn almost fell on him because of their loveof the Qur'an and Muhammad (pbuh) when they heard him recite the Qur'an in Batn Nakhl.
72|20|(Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I pray unto Allah only) I worship Allah only and call people to worshipnone but Him, (and ascribe unto Him no partner.
72|21|Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Lo! I control not hurt) I cannot drive away from you harm,forsakenness or chastisement (nor benefit for you) nor can I give you benefit and guidance.
72|22|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Lo! none can protect me from Allah) from Allah's chastisement if I disobeyHim, (nor can I find any refuge beside Him) nor can I find any escape or hiding place from Allah'schastisement if I disobey Him.
72|23|((Mine is) but conveyance (of the Truth) from Allah) he says: nothing can save me except conveyance onbehalf of Allah, (and His messages; and whoso disobeyeth Allah) regarding Allah's divine Oneness (and Hismessenger) in his conveyance of the message, (lo! His) in the Hereafter (is fire of hell, wherein such dwellforever) never to die or leave it.
72|24|(Till (the day)) He says: wait for them until the day (when they shall behold that which they are promised)of chastisement; (but then they will know for certain) this is a threat from Allah to them (who is weaker inallies and less in multitude) who has less helpers.
72|25|(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I know not whether that which ye are promised) of chastisement (is nigh, orif my Lord hath set a distant term for it.
72|26|(He is) the knower of the Unseen) He knows when the chastisement will happen, (and He revealeth untonone His secret,
72|27|Save unto every messenger whom he hath chosen) He reveals to them some instances of the Unseen, (andthen He maketh a guard) angels (to go before him) before the messenger (and a guard behind him) toprotect him from the jinn, devils and human beings so that they do not hear Gabriel reciting the revelations.
72|28|(That He) that Muhammad (pbuh) (may know that they) i.e. the messengers (have indeed conveyed themessages of their Lord) the angels protected them just as they are protecting you; it is also said that thismeans: so that the messengers, Muhammad and other messengers, know that the angels have conveyedthe message from Allah; and it is also said that this means: so that the jinn and human beings know that themessengers have conveyed the messages of their Lord. (He surroundeth all their doings) He has fullknowledge of all the angels that surround them, (and He keepeth count of all things) it is also said that Heknows their number just as He knows the state of the one who is wrapped up in his raiment'.
73|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning Allah's saying (O thouwrapped up in your raiment!): '(O thou wrapped up in your raiment!) He is referring here to Muhammad(pbuh) who wrapped himself up in his raiment in order to pray.
73|2|(Keep vigil the night long) in prayer, then He said (save a little);
73|3|He explained further, saying: (A half thereof) i.e. pray during half of the night, (or abate a little thereof) lessthan half and up to a third of the night,
73|4|(Or add (a little) thereto) or pray more than half of the night, up to two thirds of the night, thus giving him achoice, and then He said: (and chant the Qur'an in measure) recite the Qur'an deliberately, unhurriedly andwith gravity, i.e. reciting two or three verses each time until you finish the whole recitation,
73|5|(For We shall charge thee) for We shall send you Gabriel (with a word of weight) with mighty wordscontaining commands and prohibitions, promises and threats, the lawful and unlawful; it is also said thismeans: with a tremendous word; and it is also said this means: a word that is heavy on whoevercontravenes it; and it is also said this means: a weighty word in the prayer of the night.
73|6|(Lo! the vigil of the night) spent in praying (is (a time) when impression is more keen) the vigil of the nightand praying at this time give a person more vigour in his prayer, when he seeks by it Allah's sake alone; it isalso said this means: it is gentler and milder on the heart (and speech more certain) the recitation of theQur'an is clearer and firmer.
73|7|(Lo! thou hast by day) O Muhammad (a chain of business) a long period of time to attend to your needs.
73|8|(So remember the name of thy Lord) so pray by the command of your Lord; and it is also said this means:remember your Lord's divine Oneness (and devote thyself with a complete devotion) be completely sincereto Allah in your prayers, supplications and acts of worship.
73|9|(Lord of the East and the West) is Allah; (there is no God save Him; so choose you Him alone for thydefender) worship Him as a Lord; it is also said this means: take Him as a Guardian regarding that which Hepromised you of help, supremacy and reward.
73|10|(And bear with patience) O Muhammad (what they utter) of vilification and denial, (and part from them witha fair leave-taking) steer clear of them in a fair way, neither grieving nor reciprocating with indecency.
73|11|(Leave Me to deal with the deniers) of the Qur'an-this is a threat to them; and the ones specifically meantby this threat are those who fed the army of the disbelievers on the Day of Badr-, (lords of ease and comfort(in this life)) those who have wealth and richness; (and do thou respite them awhile) until the Day of Badr.
73|12|(Lo! with Us) for them in the Hereafter (are heavy fetters) with which their hands will be tied to their necksand chains will also be put around their necks (and a raging fire) which they will enter,
73|13|(And food) the Zaqqum (which choketh (the partaker), and a painful doom) whose pain will extend to theirhearts.
73|14|Then Allah explained when this will take place, saying: (On the day when the earth and the hills rock) on theday when the earth and the mountains will quake, (and the hills become a heap of running sand.
73|15|Lo! We have sent unto you a messenger) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (as witness against you) that he hasconveyed the message, (even as We sent unto Pharaoh a messenger) i.e. Moses.
73|16|(But Pharaoh rebelled against the messenger) i.e. Moses, and did not accept his call, (whereupon We seizedhim with no gentle grip) therefore We punished him with a severe punishment, i.e. by drowning.
73|17|(Then how) will you ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, O people of Mecca (if ye disbelieve) in thelife of the world, (will ye protect yourselves upon the day) the Day of Judgement (which will turn childrengrey) when they hear Allah say to Adam: "O Adam! Send a group from your progeny to the Fire". Adam willsay: "O Lord! How many?" Allah will say: "From every one thousand, send 999 to the Fire and one person tothe Garden",
73|18|(The very heaven being then) when the children turn grey; and it is said: due to the descent of thecommand of the Lord and the angels (rent asunder. His promise) regarding the resurrection (is to befulfilled) is to take place.
73|19|(Lo! This) surah (is a Reminder) is an admonition and clarification for you. (Let him who will, then, choose away unto his Lord) a way to head towards Allah; it is also said this means: let him who will use this to returnto his Lord.
73|20|(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly) less than (two thirds of thenight) up to half of the night, (or (sometimes) half) and sometimes you keep vigil half of the night (or athird thereof) and you keep vigil a third of the night; it is also said this means: and sometimes less than halfof the night, (as do a party of those with thee) and a group of believers with you who keep vigil of the nightin prayer. (Allah measureth the night and the day) Allah knows the hours of the day and night. (He knoweththat ye count it not) i.e. keep track of the hours of the night; it is also said that this means: He knows youwill not be able to persevere in that which you are commanded of prayer in the night, (and turneth unto youin mercy) and so He forgives you if you do not pray at night. (Recite, then, of the Qur'an) when you performthe prayers (that which is easy for you) 100 verses and more; and it is also said this means: whatever youwish to recite of the Qur'an. (He knoweth that there are sick folk among you) wounded people among youwho cannot pray at night, (while others travel in the land) fleeing from something or (in search of Allah'sbounty) of Allah's provision and other things, and it is hard on them to pray at night, (and others (still) arefighting for the cause of Allah) for the obedience of Allah who will find it hard to pray at night. (So recite ofit) of the Qur'an in your prayers (that which is easy (for you), and establish worship) complete the five dailyprayers including what is required for its validity of ritual ablution, bowings, prostrations and the observationof their due times (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and (so) lend unto Allah) by giving to charity;and it is also said: by doing righteous works (a goodly loan) truly and sincerely from your hearts.(Whatsoever good) alms or righteous works (ye send before you for your souls, ye will surely find it) find itsreward (with Allah) in Paradise preserved for you, neither stolen, drowned, burnt or eaten by borer, (better)than what you have left in the life of the world (and greater in the recompense) than that which you have.(And seek forgiveness of Allah) from your sins. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents,(Merciful) towards he who dies repentant, because of the mercy of he who is enveloped in his cloak'.
74|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (O thou enveloped in your cloak): '(O thou enveloped in your cloak) addressing the Prophet (pbuh)who had enveloped himself in his cloak to sleep
74|2|(Arise and warn!) warn people and call them to profess Allah's divine Oneness.
74|3|(Your Lord magnify) Exonerate your Lord from what the idol worshippers say about Him,
74|4|(Your raiment purify) from filth; it is also said this means: and shorten your raiment; and it is also said thismeans: purify your heart from betrayal, treachery and exasperation; i.e. be pure of heart,
74|5|(Pollution shun!) shun all sins and do not go near them.
74|6|(And show not favour, seeking worldly gain!) such that you give a little and receive instead what is more andbetter in the life of the world; it is also said this means: do not deem the works you do for Allah to be toomuch.
74|7|(For the sake of thy Lord, be patient!) Be patient in the worship and obedience of your Lord.
74|8|(For when the trumpet shall sound) which is the sound of the Trumpet announcing the Resurrection,
74|9|(Surely that day) i.e. the Day of Judgement (will be a day of anguish) will be a severe day,
74|10|(Not of ease, for disbelievers) i.e. its horrors and torment are not easy for the disbelievers.
74|11|(Leave Me) O Muhammad ((to deal) with him whom I created lonely) without wealth, children or spouse,this is a threat from Allah to al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi.
74|12|(And then) afterwards (bestowed upon him ample means) of all kinds, and his wealth kept increasing untilhe had in his possession 9,000 measures of silver,
74|13|(And sons abiding in his presence) never out of his sight. He had ten sons.
74|14|(And made (life) smooth for him) he had his wealth piled up just as one piles up couches on top of eachother.
74|15|(Yet he) i.e. al-Walid (desireth that I should give more) wealth while disobeying and disbelieving in Me.
74|16|(Nay!) I will not give him more. And since then his wealth kept decreasing. (For lo! He) i.e. al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah (hath been stubborn to Our revelations) to Our Scripture and Messenger; he turned away fromthem in disbelief.
74|17|(On him I shall impose a fearful doom) I shall make him climb a smooth rock in the Fire such that wheneverhe puts his hands on it, he wwould melt, and then he will be restored to how he used to be; it is also saidthat Allah will make him climb a rock of copper which pulls him from the front and hits him from the back.
74|18|(For lo! He) i.e. al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah (did consider) within himself the matter of Muhammad (pbuh);(then he planned) to say that he is a wizard
74|19|((Self) destroyed is he) cursed is he, (how he planned!) his saying about Muhammad (pbuh)
74|20|(Again (self) destroyed is he) again cursed is he, (how he planned!) his saying about Muhammad (pbuh)
74|21|(Then looked he) he considered again his saying that the Prophet was a wizard; it is also said that thismeans: then he considered the words of the prophetic Companions when they said to him: "Come and jointhat which is good, O Ibn al-Mughirah!",
74|22|(Then frowned he and showed displeasure.
74|23|Then turned he away) from the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) and returned to his family (in pride) tooproud to accept faith and listen to them.
74|24|(And said: This) which Muhammad (pbuh) says (is naught else than magic from of old) magic which he tookfrom Musaylimah the liar in al-Yamamah and he is now relating it to us; it is also said that this means: whathe says is taken from Jabr and Yasar;
74|25|(This) which Muhammad (pbuh) says, is (naught else than speech of mortal man) the speech of Jabr andYasar.
74|26|(Him) al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah (shall I fling) in the Hereafter (unto the burning) unto the fourth gate of theFire.
74|27|(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what that burning is!
74|28|It leaveth naught) any of their flesh except that it devours it; (It spareth naught) and it devours them whenthey are restored again to their former shape.
74|29|(It shriveleth the man) it disfigures their bodies and darkens their faces.
74|30|(Above it) above the Fire (are nineteen) angels; they are the keepers of the Fire.
74|31|(We have appointed) We set on the dwellers of the Fire (only angels) the keepers of the Fire (to be wardensof the Fire, and their number have We made) and We have not mentioned the fewness of the keepers of theFire save (to be a stumbling block) except in order to be a calamity (for those who disbelieve) thedisbelievers of Mecca: Abu'l-Ashadd Ibn Usayd Ibn Kildah who said: "I will take care of seventeen angels,nine on my back and eight on my chest; therefore you should take care of the other two"; (that those towhom the scripture) the Torah, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, for it is written in the Torah thatthe number of the keepers of the Fire is nineteen (hath been given may have certainty, and that believersmay increase in faith) when they know that what is in their Scripture is similar to that which is in the Torah;(and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, when theysee that there is no difference between what is in the Qur'an and that which is in the Torah (and believers)also for the same reason (may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease) doubt andhypocrisy, (and disbelievers) the Jews and Christians; and it is said: the disbelievers of Mecca, (may say:What meaneth Allah by this similitude) when he mentioned the small number of angels who are in charge ofthe Fire? (Thus Allah sendeth astray) through this similitude (whom He will) whomever deserves it, (andwhom He will) and whomever deserves (He guideth) by means of this similitude. (None knoweth the hostsof your Lord) among the angels (save Him. This is) i.e. Saqar, the fourth gate of the Fire (naught else than aReminder unto mortals) an admonition to people in order to warn them.
74|32|(Nay, by the Moon) Allah swore by the moon
74|33|(And the night when it withdraweth

74|36|(As a warning unto men) it is also said this means: Muhammad (pbuh) is a warner unto mankind. This leadsus to the beginning of the surah and Allah's saying (Arise and warn), this latter part being mentioned lastwhen it is the first part of the sequence,
74|37|(Unto him of you who will advance) towards goodness (or hang back) from evil and therefore holds backfrom it; it is also said this means: or hang back from goodness and therefore disbelieve; this being a threatto them.
74|38|(Every soul) every disbelieving soul (is a pledge) in the Fire for eternity (for its own deeds) which it hasearned in its state of disbelief;

74|44|(Nor did we feed the wretched) we did not encourage giving alms to the needy nor were we among thosewho gave the poor-due or alms.

74|48|(The mediation of no mediators will avail them then) Allah says: the intercession of the angels, prophets andrighteous ones will not benefit them.

75|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah's(Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection): '(Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection) He says: I swear thatthe Day of Resurrection will happen;
75|2|(Nay, I swear by the accusing soul (that this Scripture is true)) and I swear by every righteous and sinfulsoul that will blame itself on the Day of Resurrection. As for the righteous soul, it will say: if only I did morerighteous works. And as for the sinful soul, it will say: if only I abstained from committing sins. Both soulswill say this upon seeing the reward and punishment awaiting each one of them respectively. It is also saidthat the accusing soul in question is the soul that reproaches itself; and it is also said: it is the soul thatrepents of its sins and reproaches itself for what it had committed; and it is also said it is the sinful,disbelieving soul.
75|3|(Thinketh man) does the disbelieving man, 'Adiyy Ibn Rabi'ah, think because he did not believe in theresurrection (that We shall not assemble his bones) that We are not able to gather his bones after theyscatter, change and turn into dust?

75|5|(But man) the disbelieving man: 'Adiyy Ibn Rabi'ah (would fain deny what is before him) would fain toindulge in his evil acts and delay his repentance; it is also said this means: he would fain to engage in evildeeds and indecencies in his future days.
75|6|(He asketh) 'Adiyy Ibn Rabi'ah asks in his denial of the resurrection: (When will be this Day of Resurrection)when will the Day of Resurrection take place?

75|16|(Stir not thy tongue) to read the Qur'an, O Muhammad, (herewith to hasten it) to hasten the recitation ofthe Qur'an before Gabriel finishes reciting it to you. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to repeatwhatever revelations of the Qur'an Gabriel brought down to him before the latter finished a sentence of theQur'an, out of fear of forgetting what was revealed to him. Allah warned him against doing so.

78|3|(Concerning which they are in disagreement) some of them disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in theQur'an while others believe in them.

78|4|(Nay) this is a reply to the disbelievers, (but they will come to know!) They will come to know upon theadvent of death what will be done with them.
78|5|(Nay) truly, (again, but they will come to know!) They will come to know in the grave what will be done withthem. This is a threat from Allah to those who disbelieved in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an.
78|6|Allah then mentioned the blessings He bestowed upon them, saying: (Have We not made the earth anexpanse) and a place to sleep,

78|27|(For lo! they looked not) while in the life of the world (for a reckoning) they did not fear the chastisement ofthe Hereafter nor did they believe in it;
78|28|(They called Our revelations) Our Scripture and Messenger (false with strong denial.

78|38|(On the day when the angels and the Spirit) Gabriel; and it is also said: this is a created being whosetremendousness only Allah knows; Ibn Mas'ud also said: the Spirit is an angel greater than every thing savethe Throne, and this angel glorifies Allah each day 12,000 formulas of glorification, and which eachglorification he utters Allah creates an angel who seeks forgiveness for the believers until the Day ofJudgement; it is also said this refers to a group of angels who have feet and hands like those of humans(stand arrayed, they speak not) to intercede, (saving him whom the Beneficent alloweth) to intercede (andwho speaketh right) truly "there is no deity save Allah".
78|39|(That is the True Day) in which will happen what I have mentioned. (So whoso will should seek recourse)whoever will believe in Allah's divine Oneness and seek through his belief in Allah's divine Oneness a way ofreturn (unto his Lord.
78|40|Lo! We warn you) O people of Mecca (of a doom at hand) which will surely happen, (a day whereon a manwill look) when the believer will look; and it is also said: when the disbeliever will look (on that which hisown hands have sent before) have earned of good or evil, (and the disbeliever will cry: "Would that I weredust!") with the beasts. Because of the horrors, severity and torment of that day, the disbeliever will wish tobe turned into dust along with beasts. This will occur on the day when the first trumpet resounds'.
79|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (By those who drag forth): '(By those who drag forth) He says: Allah swears by the angels who takeaway the souls of the disbelievers (to destruction) the souls of the disbelievers,
79|2|(By the meteors rushing) and it is also said that He is here swearing by the angels who busy the disbelieverswith grief and anxiety; it is also said that this refers to the souls of the believers which hasten to come outof their bodies in order to go to the Garden.
79|3|(By the lone stars floating) and it is also said that He is here swearing by the angels who take away thesouls of the righteous slowly and gently and then let them rest; it is also said this refers to the souls of thebelievers,
79|4|(By the angels hastening) and He swears by the angels who hasten to Paradise with the souls of thebelievers and to the Fire with the souls of the disbelievers; it is also said this refers to the souls of thebelievers that hasten to Paradise,
79|5|(And those who govern the event) and He swears by the angels who govern the matters of the slaves,meaning Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel and the angel of death. It is said that (those who govern the event)refers to the spears of soldiers, (the meteors rushing) refers to the ropes of soldiers and (the lone starsfloating) refers to the ships of soldiers who fight at sea, (the ones who do the hastening) refers to thehorses of soldiers, while (those who govern the event) refers to the generals of soldiers; it is also said that(the lone stars floating) refer to the sun, the moon, the day and the night. Allah swore by all these that thetwo blowings of the trumpet will take place, with an interval of 40 years separating the two blowings.
79|6|So Allah said: (On the day when the first trump resoundeth) this refers to the first blowing of the trumpetwhen everything will quake.
79|7|(And the second followeth it) this is the final blowing on the trumpet,
79|8|(On that day) which is the Day of Judgement (hearts beat painfully) the hearts are fearful
79|9|(While eyes are downcast) abased
79|10|((Now) they) the disbelievers of Mecca: al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his host (are saying: Shall we really berestored to our first state) to the life of the world; and it is also said: from the graves
79|11|(Even after we are crumbled bones?) Will Allah resurrect us? How is this possible?
79|12|The Prophet (pbuh) said to them: "Indeed, Allah will raise you again from the dead". (They say: Then thatwould be a vain proceeding) that would be a failed attempt, because it will never happen.
79|13|And so Allah said: (Surely it will need but one shout) one blow which does not require a second one, andthis is the blow of the resurrection,
79|14|(And lo! they will be awakened) on the face of the earth; and it is also said: in the land of the gathering.
79|15|(Hath there come unto thee) O Muhammad (the history of Moses) the story of Moses? Meaning: the story ofMoses has already come to you; and it is also said this means: the story of Moses has not yet come to you.
79|16|(How his Lord called him in the holy vale of Tuwa) the name of the valley; it was called so because it wastraversed by so many prophets; it is also said: tread (Ta'), O Moses, with your feet on this valley because ofits goodness and grace.
79|17|((Saying:) Go thou) O Moses (unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath rebelled) he is arrogant and too proud and hasrefused to believe in Allah
79|18|(And say (unto him): Hast thou) O Pharaoh ((will) to grow (in grace)) will become righteous, surrender andbelieve in Allah's divine Oneness?
79|19|(Then I will guide thee) I will call you (to thy Lord and thou shalt fear (Him)) and therefore surrender toHim.
79|20|(And he) Moses (showed him the tremendous token) the hand and the staff.
79|21|(But be denied) and said: this is not from Allah (and disobeyed) he refused the message,
79|22|(Then turned he away) from faith; and it is also said: from Moses (in haste) to his folk; and it is also said: tothink what to do about Moses,
79|23|(Then gathered he) his army (and summoned) and delivered a sermon
79|24|(And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest".) I am your Highest Lord and the Lord of youridols, therefore, do not leave the worship of these idols.
79|25|(So Allah seized him) Allah punished him ((and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former)the punishment that he suffered in the life of the world is drowning and the punishment of the Hereafter willbe in the Fire; it is also said that this means: Allah has punished him because of his former and latterpronouncements. His first pronouncement being: "I do not know of any other god for you except Me" andthe second being (I am your Lord the Highest) and it is said that there is an interval of 40 years between thefirst and second pronouncements.
79|26|(Lo! Herein) in that which We did to Pharaoh and his host (is indeed a lesson) an admonition (for him whofeareth) that which has been done to them.
79|27|(Are ye) O people of Mecca (the harder to create) harder to resurrect and more perfect in your creation, (oris the heaven that He built?
79|28|He raised the height) its ceiling (thereof and ordered it) above the earth;
79|29|(And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof) and He made its day and sunclear.
79|30|(And after that He spread the earth) even then He spread it on the water; it is also said: 2,000 years afterthat He spread it on the water,
79|31|(And produced therefrom) from the earth (the water thereof) running water as well as the water burieddeep in the belly of the earth (and the pasture thereof,
79|32|And He made fast the hills) and He made the mountains firm,
79|33|(A provision for you) water of benefit to you (and for your cattle) water and pasture benefit your cattle.
79|34|(But when the great disaster cometh) but when the Hour comes, it will tower above everything and nothingwill escape it,
79|35|(The day when man will call to mind) when the disbeliever, al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his host, will rememberand know (his (whole) endeavour) the works he did in his state of disbelief,
79|36|(And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth) to him who is ordained to enter it,
79|37|(Then, as for him who rebelled) him who was too arrogant and proud and disbelieved in Allah, i.e. al-NadrIbn al-Harith Ibn 'Alqamah
79|38|(And chose the life of the world) rather than the Hereafter and also chose disbelief rather than faith,
79|39|(Lo! Hell will be his home) the Fire is the home of him who is thus.
79|40|(But as for him who feared) upon committing a sin (to stand before his Lord) his standing before his Lordand abstains from engaging in sin (and restrained his soul from lust) from that which is unlawful, eventhough he desires it, this refers to Mus'ab Ibn 'Umayr.
79|41|(Lo! the Garden will be his home) Paradise will be the home of him who is thus.
79|42|(They ask thee) the disbelievers of Mecca ask you, O Muhammad, (of the Hour) about the advent of theHour: (when will it come to port?) When is it going to happen? Because they disbelieved in it.
79|43|(Why (ask they)? What hast thou to tell thereof?) What has it to do with you that you should mention it tothem?
79|44|(Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof) the knowledge of its timing belongs to Allah.
79|45|(Thou art but a warner) you are but a warning messenger by means of the Qur'an (unto him who feareth it)to him who fears its advent.
79|46|(On the day when they behold it) i.e. the Hour, (it will be as if they had but tarried) in the graves (for anevening) the duration of an evening (or the morn thereof) or the duration of one morning'.
80|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (He frowned): '(He frowned) He says: Muhammad (pbuh) showed a stern face (and turned away) hisface
80|2|(Because the blind man came unto him) when 'Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum came to him. His real name is'Abdullah Ibn Shurayh. Umm Maktum was his father's mother. What happened is that the Prophet (pbuh)was sitting with a group of men among the nobles of Quraysh, among whom were his uncle al-'Abbas Ibn'Abd al-Muttalib, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi and Safwan Ibn Umayyah, who were at that timedisbelievers. The Prophet (pbuh) was admonishing and inviting them to Islam when Ibn Maktum came tohim and said: "O Messenger of Allah! Teach me of that which Allah has taught you". The Prophet (pbuh)turned his face from him because he was busy with these people. When this happened Allah revealed: hefrowned and turned away because the blind man came unto him.
80|3|(What could inform thee) O Muhammad (but that he might) i.e. the blind man (grow (in grace)) becamerighteous through the admonitions of the Qur'an
80|4|(Or take heed) by means of the Qur'an (and so the reminder) by means of the Qur'an (might avail him?) Itis also said that this means: how do you know O Muhammad, whether or not he becomes righteous andwhether or not he benefits from the admonitions of the Qur'an.
80|5|(As for him who thinketh himself independent) of Allah, i.e. the three men mentioned above,
80|6|(Unto him thou payest regard) you turn your face to them.
80|7|(Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace)) it is not your concern if these three men do not believe inAllah's divine Oneness.
80|8|(But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose) hastening for goodness
80|9|(And hath fear) of Allah, and is also a Muslim; this is because Ibn Umm Maktum had accepted Islam beforethis incident,
80|10|(From him thou) O Muhammad (art distracted) being busy with those three men.
80|11|(Nay) do not do this; He says: do not turn to those who think themselves independent of Allah and turnaway from he who fears Allah. After this reminder, the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour Ibn Umm Maktumand treat him well, (but verily it) this surah (is an Admonishment) from Allah both for the rich and the poor,
80|12|(So let whosoever will pay heed to it) whoever Allah wants him to be admonished will be admonished,
80|13|(On honoured leaves) He says: the Qur'an is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sightof Allah
80|14|(Exalted) in heaven, (purified) from filth and idolatry,
80|15|((Set down) by scribes) written by scribes
80|16|(Noble) in the sight of Allah and surrendered to Him (and righteous) truthful; these are the keepers of thenether heaven.
80|17|(Man is (self)-destroyed) the disbeliever, i.e. 'Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab, is cursed: (how ungrateful!) what hasmade him a disbelieve in Allah and in the stars of the Qur'an, i.e. in the star when it sets; it is also said thatthis means: how extreme is his disbelief.
80|18|(From what thing doth He create him?) He says: let him think about his own person: from what did Hecreate him as a living being?
80|19|Allah then explained and said to him: (From a drop of seed. He createth him) a living being (andproportioneth him) He proportioned his creation by giving him two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ears aswell as all the other organs,
80|20|(Then maketh the way easy for him) He made clear to him the way of good and the way of evil; and it isalso said this means: He made easy for him to come out of the way of the womb,
80|21|(Then causeth him to die) after this, (and burieth him) and commanded to bury him;
80|22|(Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life) i.e. He will resurrect him from the grave.
80|23|(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but (man) hath not done what He commanded him) of profession of Allah'sdivine Oneness and other things.
80|24|(Let man consider his food) let the disbelieving person, 'Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab, think about the food he eats,how it is transformed from state to state until it reaches him to eat:
80|25|Allah then explained these different states, saying: (How We pour water) i.e. rain (in showers) upon theearth
80|26|(Then split the earth in clefts) through plants
80|27|(And cause the grain) all kinds of grain (to grow therein) in the earth
80|28|(And grapes and green fodder
80|29|And olive trees and palm-trees
80|30|And garden closes of thick foliage
80|31|And fruits) different kinds of fruit (and grasses) and fodder; and it also said this means: straw:
80|32|(Provision for you) the grains are of benefit to you (and your cattle) and fodder is of benefit to your cattle.
80|33|(But when the Shout cometh) when the Hour comes, all created beings will scream and then submit andanswer the call. Created being will be abased and know then that its advent is true.
80|34|Allah then explained when this will happen, saying: (On the day when a man) the believer (fleeth from hisbrother) who is a disbeliever
80|35|(And his mother) and will also flee from his mother (and his father
80|36|And his wife and his children) it is also said this means: when Abel will flee from Cain, and Muhammad(pbuh) will flee from his mother Aminah, and Abraham from his father, and Lot from his wife Wa'ilah andNuh from his son Canaan.
80|37|(Every man that day) on the Day of Judgement (will have concern enough to make him heedless (ofothers)) to keep him preoccupied from others.
80|38|(On that day faces) the faces of the believers who are true in their faith (will be bright as dawn) will beblooming due to Allah's pleasure with them,
80|39|(Laughing) pleased with Allah's bestowal of honour upon them, (rejoicing at good news) happy with Allah'sreward;
80|40|(And other faces) the faces of the hypocrites and disbelievers, (on that day) on the Day of Judgement, (withdust upon them,
80|41|Veiled in darkness) gloomy and dark,
80|42|(Those) with such a trait (are the disbelievers) in Allah, (the wicked) the liars against Allah'.
81|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (When the sun is overthrown): '(When the sun is overthrown) it is also said that He says: when thesun is turned around as one turns a turban and is then thrown into the veil of light; it is also said thismeans: when the light of the sun vanishes.
81|2|(And when the stars fall) on the face of the earth,
81|3|(And when the hills are moved) from above the surface of the earth
81|4|(And when the camels big with young are abandoned) because they are preoccupied with their own selves,
81|5|(And when the wild beasts are herded together) for retaliation; and it is also said this means: when they aredead,
81|6|(And when the seas rise) and mix with each other, the sweet seas and the salty seas, such that theybecome one sea; and it is also said this means: when they become a burning site,
81|7|(And when souls are reunited) in pairs; it is also said this means: when souls are reunited with theircompanions: the believer with the maiden of Paradise and the disbeliever with Satan; the righteous with therighteous and the sinful with the sinful,
81|8|(And when the girl child that was buried alive is asked) i.e. when she asks her father
81|9|(For what sin she was slain) for what sin did you kill me; it is also said that this means: when the one whokilled her is asked: for what sin did you kill her,
81|10|(And when the pages) the registers of good and bad deeds (are laid open) for reckoning; it is also said thismeans: when they fly about in people's hands,
81|11|(And when the sky is torn away,

81|17|(And the close of night,
81|18|And the breath of morning) and when the morning and brightens come; Allah swore by all these
81|19|(That this) i.e. the Qur'an (is in truth the word of an honoured messenger) Allah says: it is brought down byGabriel to a messenger who is honoured by Allah, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh)
81|20|(Mighty) against his enemies, i.e. Gabriel, (established in the presence of the Lord of the Throne) he hasstanding and esteem with his Lord,
81|21|((One) to be obeyed) i.e. Gabriel is obeyed in Heaven: the angels obey him, (and trustworthy) in conveyingthe message to the prophets;
81|22|(And your comrade) your Prophet Muhammad, O Quraysh (is not mad) bewitched as you claim.
81|23|(Surely he beheld him) Muhammad saw Gabriel (on the clear horizon) on the high setting of the sun.
81|24|(And he is not) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (avid of the Unseen) he is accused with regard to the revelation; andit is also said this means: he is not avaricious.
81|25|(Nor is this) i.e. the Qur'an (the utterance of a devil worthy to be stoned) the utterance of an accursed,rebellious devil whose name is al-Marmi.
81|26|(Whither then go ye) from Allah's chastisement, commands and prohibitions, O disbelievers? It is also saidthis means: why do you lie? And it is also said this means: why do you deviate from the Qur'an and refuseto believe in it?
81|27|(This is) i.e. the Qur'an (naught else than a reminder) an admonition from Allah (unto creation) the jinn andhumankind,
81|28|(Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight) to whoever wills to conform to the commands of Allah:the belief in Allah's divine Oneness and other things.
81|29|(And ye will not) conform with or believe in Allah's divine Oneness, (unless (it be) that Allah willeth) it foryou, (the Lord of Creation) the Lord of all that which has a soul and creeps on the face of the earth, fromthe inhabitants of the heaven and of the earth'.
82|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (When the heaven is cleft asunder): '(When the heaven is cleft asunder) by the descent of the Lord-adescent without modality-and the angels and whatever He wills of His command,

82|5|(A soul) every soul at that point (will know what it hath sent before (it)) of good or evil (and what leftbehind) of good or evil wont; it is also said this means: it will know the acts of obedience it offered andthose it missed.
82|6|(O man!) i.e. O disbelieving man; here referring specifically to Kildah Ibn Usayd (What hath made theecareless concerning thy Lord) when you disbelieved in Him, (the Bountiful) the Forgiving,

82|8|(Into whatsoever form He will, He casteth thee) if He wills He makes you resemble your paternal ormaternal uncles, He can make you handsome or ugly; and if He wills He can turn you into the form of anape or swine, or the like of them.
82|9|(Nay) truly, (but they) the Quraysh (deny the Judgement) and the Reckoning.
82|10|(Lo! there are above you guardians) among the angels who guard and preserve your works,
82|11|(Generous) who are honoured in the sight of Allah and completely surrendered to Him (and recording) theyrecord your works,
82|12|(Who know (all) that ye do) and say of good and evil and record all of it.

82|14|(And lo! the wicked) Kildah and his fellow disbelievers (verily will be in hell;

82|17|(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what the Day of Judgement is!) what is the Day ofReckoning. (Again, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad
82|18|(what the Day of Judgement is!) what the Day of Reckoning is. He said this to arouse his astonishment, inorder to magnify such a Day.
82|19|Allah the explained to him, saying: (A day on which no soul) no believing soul (hath power at all) no powerto save or intercede (for any (other) soul) for any disbelieving soul. (The (absolute) command) sentencingand judging between people (on that day is Allah's) is in Allah's hands; none other than Him has that in hispower and none will challenge Him about it'.
83|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying: (Woe unto the defrauders): '(Woe) severe punishment (unto the defrauders) in weighing andmeasurement; this refers to the people of Medina who used to cheat in weighing and measurement beforethe coming of the Prophet (pbuh) and so this surah was revealed to the Prophet (pbuh) on his way when hewas migrating to Medina:
83|2|Allah then explained who these defrauders are, saying: (Those who when they take the measure frommankind) those who, when they buy from people and weigh or measure that which they buy for themselves,(demand it full) they weigh and measure their merchandise in full,
83|3|(But if they measure unto them) but when they measure for others (or weigh for them, they cause themloss) they decrease the measurement or the weight and behave very badly; it is also said that the abovemeans: severe punishment on that day is unto the defrauders in the prayer, the poor-due, fasting and otheracts of worship.
83|4|(Do such (men)) those who deal in fraud in weight and measurement (not consider) not know and believe(that they will be raised again) brought back to life

83|6|(The day when (all) mankind stand) after emerging from the graves (before the Lord of the Worlds) the Lordof every living being who walks on the earth and the Lord of the dwellers of heaven? When the Prophet(pbuh) read to them this surah, they repented and started giving full weight and measurement.
83|7|(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but the record of the vile) the works of the disbelievers (is in Sijjin
83|8|Ah! what will convey unto thee what Sijjin is) what is in Sijjin! This is mentioned by way of aggrandizementof Sijjin.
83|9|(A written record) He says: the works of the children of Adam are written on a green rock under the seventhearth; this is Sijjin.
83|10|(Woe) severe punishment (unto the repudiators) unto the deniers of faith and the resurrection (on that day)the Day of Judgement!

83|14|(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but that which they have earned) which they have done and said in their stateof idolatry (is rust upon their hearts) Allah has sealed the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Day ofJudgement; it is also said that the accumulation of sins blackens the heart and this is what is meant by therust of hearts.
83|15|(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but surely on that day) the Day of Judgement (they) i.e. the deniers of the Dayof Judgement (will be covered from (the mercy of) their Lord) they will be prevented from beholding theirLord while the believers will behold Him.

96|15|(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but if he cease not) if Abu Jahl does not repent of harming the Prophet (pbuh).(We will seize him by the forelock

96|19|(Nay) truly, O Muhammad! (Obey not thou him) i.e. obey not Abu Jahl when he wants you not to pray toyour Lord. (But prostrate thyself) to your Lord, (and draw near (unto Allah)) through prostration.
97|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Lo! We revealed it): '(Lo! We revealed it) He says: We sent Gabriel with the entire Qur'an to thescribes of the nether heaven (on the Night of Power) on the night of judgement and decree; it is also saidthis means: on a night blessed with forgiveness and mercy, and then it was revealed to the Prophet (pbuh)in instalments.
97|2|(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad-this is said out of glorification of this night-(what the Nightof Power is) what the merit of the Night of Power is!
97|3|He then explained its merit by saying: (The Night of Power is better than a thousand months) He says:works in this night are better than works performed in 1,000 months which do not include such a night.
97|4|(The angels and the Spirit) Gabriel with them (descend therein) at the beginning of the Night of Power, (bythe permission of their Lord) by the command of their Lord, (with all decrees.

98|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah'ssaying (Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture): '(Those who disbelieve among the Peopleof the Scripture) i.e. the Jews and Christians (and the idolaters) the Arab idolaters (could not have left off(erring)) could not have remained in their denial of Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (till the clearproof came unto them) until clarification of what is in their Scriptures, the Scriptures of the Jews andChristians, came to them. There is another way of understanding the above: those who disbelieve amongthe people of the Scripture, before the advent Muhammad (pbuh) such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and hisfollowers, and those who ascribed partners to Allah before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such as AbuBakr and his fellow Arabs, would not have desisted from their disbelief and idolatry until the clear proofcame to them, i.e. until Muhammad (pbuh) came to them.
98|2|(A messenger from Allah) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (reading) to them (purified pages) pages purified fromidolatry

98|4|(Nor were the People of the Scripture divided) those who were given the Torah, i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf andhis host, did not differ about Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (until after the clear proof came untothem) until the clarification of what is in their Scripture regarding the traits and description of Muhammad(pbuh) came to them.
98|5|(And they are ordered) in all the Scriptures (naught else than to serve Allah) nothing else but to professAllah's divine Oneness, (keeping religion pure for Him) through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (asmen by nature upright) as ones surrendered unto Him, (and to establish worship) and perform the five dailyprayers after declaring their profession in Allah's divine Oneness (and to pay the poor-due) from their wealthafter that. Allah then mentioned belief in Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (That) i.e. belief in Allah's divineOneness (is true religion) the religion of truth, straight without any crookedness; it is also said that thismeans: that, i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness, is the religion of the angels; and it is also said this means:it is the religion of those who are by nature upright; and it is also said this means: the religion of Abraham.
98|6|(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (among the People of the Scripture andthe idolaters) i.e. the idolaters among the people of Mecca, (will abide in fire of hell) never to die therein orleave it. (They are the worst of created beings.
98|7|(And) lo! those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and hisfollowers and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his companions (and do good works) acts of obedience privatelybetween themselves and their Lord (are the best of created beings.

(Allah hath pleasure in them) i.e. in their faith and works (and they have pleasure in Him) in Hisreward and bestowal of honour upon Him. (This) i.e. the Gardens and good pleasure (is (in store) for himwho feareth his Lord) is for him who believes in Allah's divine Oneness such as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and hiscompanions and 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers'.
99|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying(When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake): '(When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake) Hesays: the earth is shaken and quaking and all that which is on it of trees, mountains and building iscrumbling down
99|2|(And Earth yieldeth up her burdens) and the Earth brings out her dead and treasures,
99|3|(And man) i.e. the disbeliever (saith: What aileth her?) He says this in astonishment from the horror he sees
99|4|(That day) when the earth is shaken (she will relate her chronicles) the earth will inform about the good andevil that were done on its surface,
99|5|(Because thy Lord inspires her) because your Lord gives her leave to talk.
99|6|(That day) when the earth speaks (mankind will issue forth in scattered groups) a group will go to Paradise,these are the believers, and a group will go to hell, and these are the disbelievers (to be shown their deeds)what they have done of good or evil when they were in the life of the world.
99|7|Allah then revealed the following verse about a group of people who thought that they are not rewarded forany small goodness they do nor punished for any small evil they commit, and so Allah urged them to do actsof goodness even if they are small and warned them against acts of evil even if they are small acts: (Andwhoso doeth good an atom's weight) the weight of the smallest ant (will see it then) in his register and thenwill be happy with it; it is also said: the believer sees his works in the Hereafter while the disbeliever sees hisworks in the life of the world,
99|8|(And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight) the weight of a small atom (will see it then) is written in his registerand will displease him; and it is also said: the believer sees it in the life of the world while the disbelieversees it in the Hereafter'.
100|1|And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying(By the snorting courses): '(By the snorting courses) the Prophet (pbuh) had sent a military expedition toBanu Kinanah and was quite aggrieved because he did not hear their news for a while. Allah thereforeinformed His Prophet about this expedition in the form of an oath, saying (By the snorting courses) He says:Allah swears by the horses of the conquerors, whose breaths are audible because of the enemies,
100|2|(Striking sparks of fire) with their hooves, but this fire is as beneficial as the Fire of Abu Hubahib. The latterwas one of the stingiest Arabs in camp. He never lit any fire to make bread for himself or for anyone elseuntil everybody went to sleep, and whenever someone woke up he hurried to put the Fire out so that no onewould benefit from it.
100|3|(And scouring to the raid at dawn,
100|4|Then, therewith, with their trail of dust,
100|5|Cleaving, as one, the centre (of the foe)) the above can also be understood as follow: Allah swears by thepilgrims' horses and camels when they return from 'Arafah to Muzdalifah snorting and striking sparks of fire;it is also said the latter means: performing acts which leads them to safety, i.e. the pilgrimage. And Heswears by these when they go at dawn from Muzdalifah to Mina in the evening, leaving trails of dust andsurrounding their enemies. Allah swore by all these.
100|6|(Lo!

101|3|(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what the Calamity is!) he said this to show itstremendousness.
101|4|Allah then gave more details about it, saying: (A day wherein mankind will be) a day when people will fall oneach other (as thickly scattered moths

The Banu Sahm said at that point: "We were rooted out by injustice in thepagan era; go and count the living and the dead of our people and the living and the dead of your people".When they did so they found out that the Banu Sahm were more numerous. Therefore the above verseswere revealed about them: bragging about status and lineage distracted you to the extent that you visitedthe graveyards to count the dead; it is also said that this means: increase in wealth and children distractsyou until you die and be put in the graves.
